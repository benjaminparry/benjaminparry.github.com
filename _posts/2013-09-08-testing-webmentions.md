## Ahoy Hoy!

I’m still buzzing from volunteering for [dConstruct 2013](http://2013.dconstruct.org/) where I got to hang out with some incredibly interesting and clever people and see some of the amazing talks.

I also finally got to go to the [Brighton Makers Faire](http://www.makerfairebrighton.com/) where my 2¼ year old son and I marvelled over robots and hacking on a **huge** scale.

Unfortunately I missed out on another Brighton event [IndieWebCampUK](http://indiewebcamp.com/2013/UK) but have just read Jeremy Keith’s very interesting post on [WebMentions](http://adactio.com/journal/6469/) and thought I’d give it a try.

*…tap tap, is this thing on?*
