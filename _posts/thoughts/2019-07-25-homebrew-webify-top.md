posse: A long overdue, refreshing Homebrew to counter the current scorching heat

It’s hot, really hot. To beat the sweaty squeeze on the bus I decided to hang out with the Homebrew crew for a long overdue tinker with my site.

After a good 20 minutes nerding out with Jeremy over the recent Apollo 11 delights on offer, I turned my focus to my neglected website.

I’ve been playing a lot recently, switching up the site source code and trying not to break any URLs. So I decided to double check I hadn’t also broken any Indieweb goodness I had brewed in.

Turns out I had. So I spent the ~60 mins rebuilding some of what I’d broken or removed.

Coding brew: Northern Monk, Striding Edge, Light IPA (2.8%) 👍️
