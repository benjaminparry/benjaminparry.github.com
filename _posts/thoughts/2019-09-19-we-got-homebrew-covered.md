I‚Äôve been precariously rebuilding my current site locally using Eleventy on my work computer without pushing any of the progress to another location. In fear of loosing all the hard work I decided to carve out some time to join the good folk at [Homebrew Brighton](https://indieweb.org/events/2019-09-26-homebrew-website-club).

I had a couple of things on my list, most importantly to get the code distributed in case of the worst case scenario. After the repository was pushed I cracked on with chipping away with the rebuild and made some decent progress.

Big thanks to [J√©r√¥me Coup√©](https://www.webstoemp.com/blog/from-jekyll-to-eleventy/) for sharing his tricks and tips. üçªÔ∏è Cheers!
