Craig Mod [posted a tweet](https://twitter.com/craigmod/status/1343210504378929152) explaining how using Twitter’s search can rollback the timeline to feel like “the good ol’ days”.

I took his suggestion and updated it slightly.

`https://twitter.com/search?q=filter%3Afollows%20-filter%3Areplies%20exclude%3Aretweets%20-filter%3Alinks&src=typed_query&f=live`

This does the following:

* Includes tweets by people I follow
* Excludes replies
* Excludes retweets
* Excludes links
* Orders tweets by most recent

This already feels a more engaged reading experience. I’m likely to setup a redirect and Stylish profile to make this the standard Twitter experience.

Copy the following link as a bookmark to try it yourself.
