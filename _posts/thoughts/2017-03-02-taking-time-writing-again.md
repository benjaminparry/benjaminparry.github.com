Coming off a rather intensive 2 weeks building a responsive HTML prototype, Iâ€™m taking some time to write up the notes from the last 6 weeks here are Clearleft.

Thereâ€™s a culture of writing here at Clearleft HQ. Iâ€™m sat next to Jeremy who creates written content of gargantuan proportions and is one of the self-appointed content buddies. Kate whoâ€™s about to have her book published. Ben S and [Ben W](http://thewhitesite.co.uk/){:target="_blank"} who are both on a writing mission. In-house content strategist Ellen. Not to mention those who contribute to the Clearleft blog post or their own blogs.

When I started the 3 months here at Clearleft I had grand plans to follow in the footsteps of [John Ellisonâ€™s 90 Days](https://90days.john-ellison.com){:target="_blank"} but itâ€™s been a tough act to follow up until now.

What has helped is Ellenâ€™s Content Deli â€“ a space reserved for 1 hour for those who want a quiet and distraction-free environment to write â€“ and [Benâ€™s first Slapdashery post](https://slapdashery.org/what-the-hell-is-this-69d53e43c796#.zc2s8leok){:target="_blank"} sharing techniques for frequent writing.

With a few posts already published this week and working in a culture that actively encourages writing, I can see this becoming a habit.
