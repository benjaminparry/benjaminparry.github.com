One of our most important duties as parents is to expose our children to a diverse array of intersectional characters in the stories that shape their perception and beliefs of the world.

_Note - This is an ongoing list. If you have any recommendations or spot any gaps of intersectionality, or indeed more appropriate and respectful language to use, please let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/benjaminparry), [send me an email](mailto:benjamin@parry.is), or [create a pull request](https://github.com/benjaminparry/benjaminparry.github.io)._

## Films

* [Home (2015)](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/home) - A wonderful story about friendship, being wrong and making mistakes, individuality, understanding and accepting those that are different, love and loss, dealing with emotions. The protagonist is a strong, young female person of colour. Don’t let the reviews put you off, this was fantastic!
* [Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse) - This is a stonker of a film! The visual lusciousness, wonderfully rich universe and bangin’ soundtrack are all unmatched amongst the long list of superhero films. A story about family relationships, masculinity, loss, right and wrong, finding your voice, teamwork. The protagonist is a young male person of colour as he navigates an array of male relationships and what it means to become a young man.

## TV

* [She-Ra and the Princesses of Power (2018)](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/she-ra-and-the-princesses-of-power) - An inventive reboot of the 80s TV show with a refreshing representations of strong female characters. A fantastic array of rich, honest and vulnerable characters that makes this, in my opinion, some of the best TV. It feels like more like a contemporary sitcom than a children's television programme. It follows a strong a group of strong female protagonists, mostly white, and subtly addresses femininity, friendship, identity (good/evil), understanding and choose between right and wrong.
