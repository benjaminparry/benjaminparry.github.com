## A little bit of history

I started volunteering in the summer of 2013 while in-between jobs and waiting to hear the outcomes of two second-round interviews. I had time on my hands and wanted to find a way to fill it constructively.

I stumbled upon a tweet in my timeline asking for volunteers for an upcoming conference called UX London. The company running the conference was Brighton-based UX design agency [Clearleft](http://clearleft.com/){:target="_blank"}. Being based in Brighton at the time, well Hove actually, it was a rather serendipitous moment I couldn’t afford to miss.

Since then, I’ve volunteered for the majority of Clearleft’s conferences, [UX Brighton](http://uxbrighton.org.uk/){:target="_blank"}’s annual conference and helped out where I can for smaller meetups and BarCamps. Looking back, it’s been one of the most beneficial things I’ve done and could be for you too.

## Why volunteer?

There're many reasons why you might want to offer up your time to volunteer. Perhaps you are in-between jobs like I was, or you want to gain a better understanding in a particular field in your industry, or maybe you’re new to an area and want to meet new people.

Whatever the reason there’s plenty to gain.

## What’s involved?

An average conference day goes something like this.

* 07.00 - Morning briefing
* 07.30 - Registration desk setup
* 08.00 - Registration
* 09.00 - Registration rotation and auditorium ushering
* 10.00 - Auditorium ushering and lanyard checking
* 12.30 - Grabbing lunch for speakers
* 13.00 - Registration, workshop room setup and lunch
* 14.00 - Workshop assistance and packing away registration
* 15.30 - Workshop ushering and lanyard checking
* 16.30 - Clearing workshop room
* 17.00 - Party setup
* 18.00 - Lanyard checking at party venue
* 19.00 - Doing your bit to empty the bar

There’s also additional opportunities to help prior to the event e.g. labeling lanyards, setting up the venue, packing the goodie bags. These are usually optional but earn you extra brownie points if you can help.

## Is volunteering for me?

Volunteering isn’t for everyone. Here’s a brief guide to help you make a decision.

### Volunteer if:

0. **You like getting stuck in and working hard** - it can be physically and mentally draining but a bucket load of fun and rewarding if you can hack it _(read on for my highlights)_
0. **You’re organised, pro-active and enthusiastic** - there’s months and months of planning to put into action on the day, be there or be square!
0. **Work hard and party hard _(partying is optional)_** - pre-parties, welcome parties, finale parties… _did I mention there were parties?_

### Don’t volunteer if\*:

0. **You’ve got to work on XYZ for work during the conference** - there are quiet moments but they rarely very last long and your wireframes won’t take priority
0. **You need just 5 more minutes in bed** - don’t expect a lay in or an invitation back if you’re constantly late
0. **You just want a free ticket** - you’ll end up making more enemies than friends if you can’t pull your weight

This might sound like part of a job description but that’s exactly what it is, a job. Event organisers rely on volunteers to put all of their months of organisation and planning into action on the day. Approach the challange like you would any other job, with profeciaonalism, enthusiasm and a drive for success.

\* _If any of these are deal-breakers, it’s probably safe to assume it’s not for you._

## So what are the highlights?

### Forming new friendships and extending your peer and profesional network

One of the biggest gains I’ve got from volunteering is an ever-growing network of friends.

When I volunteered for UX London in 2013 I was fairly new to UX was only starting to gain real understanding of what it was. Meeting the 20 or so other volunteers, each with a different background and career progression, was hugely insightful and encouraging.

A large proportion of the volunteers returned and over the next three years these bonds have strengthened and have developed into real friendships. A large part of the conference excitement, year-on-year, is having that opportunity to see your friends again.

Volunteering also gives you the opportunity to speak with industry leaders and other professionals attending the course, work alongside them in workshops and share a pint or two at the after party bar.
