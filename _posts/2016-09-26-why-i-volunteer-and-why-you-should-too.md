## A little bit of history

I started volunteering in the summer of 2013 while in-between jobs and waiting to hear the outcomes of two second round interviews. I had time on my hands and wanted to find a way to fill it constructively.

I stumbled upon a tweet in my timeline asking for volunteers for an upcoming UX conference in London called UX London. The company running the conference was Brighton-based UX design agency [Clearleft](http://clearleft.com/){:target="_blank"}. Being based in Brighton at the time, well Hove actually, it was a rather serendipitous moment I couldn’t afford to miss.

Since then, I’ve volunteered for the majority of Clearleft’s conferences, [UX Brighton](http://uxbrighton.org.uk/){:target="_blank"}’s annual conference and helped out where I can for smaller meetups and BarCamps. Looking back, it’s been one of the most beneficial things I’ve done and could be for you too.

## Why volunteer?

There're many reasons why you might want to offer up your time to volunteer. Perhaps you are in-between jobs like I was, or you want to gain a better understanding in a particular field in your industry, or you’re new to an area and want to meet new people.

Whatever the reason there’s plenty to gain.

## What’s involved?

An average day goes something like this.

* 07.00 - Morning briefing
* 07.30 - Registration prep
* 08.00 - Registration
* 09.00 - Registration rotation and ushering
* 10.00 - Ushering and pass checking
* 12.30 - Grabbing lunch for speakers
* 13.00 - Registration, workshop room setup and lunch
* 14.00 - Workshop assistance and packing away registration
* 15.30 - Ushering during workshop
* 16.30 - Clearing workshop room
* 17.00 - Party setup
* 18.00 - Pass checking at party venue

### Volunteer if:

0. **You like getting stuck in and working hard** - it can be physically and mentally draining but a bucket load of fun if you can hack it *(read on for my highlights)*
0. **You’re organised, pro-active and enthusiastic** - there’s months and months of planning to put into action on the day, be there or be square!
0. **Work hard and party hard *(partying is optional)*** - pre-parties, welcome parties, finale parties… *did I mention there were parties?*

### Don’t volunteer if:

0. **You’ve got to work on XYZ for work during the conference** - there are quiet moments but they rarely very last long and your wireframes won’t take priority
0. **You need just 5 more minutes in bed** - don’t expect a lay in or an invitation back if you’re constantly late
0. **You just want a free ticket** - you’ll end up making more enemies than friends if you can’t pull your weight
