> If given a choice – most users prefer to do things to learn a product rather than to read a manual or follow a set of instructions.

Four questions during a cognitive walkthrough:

> Blackmon, Polson, et al. in 2002 in their paper “Cognitive walkthrough for the Web”
> 1. Will the user try and achieve the right outcome?
> 2. Will the user notice that the correct action is available to them?
> 3. Will the user associate the correct action with the outcome they expect to achieve?
> 4. If the correct action is performed; will the user see that progress is being made towards their intended outcome?

How cognitive walkthroughs differ from heuristic evaluation.

* Cognitive walkthroughs - goal and task focused
* Heuristic evaluation - focus on entire product
