Keith makes an interesting point about the attitudes and motivations of research session observers.

>“… what’s more dangerous: someone who doesn’t attend any sessions, or someone that attends 1 or 2 sessions but misinterprets what they see and hear?”

In the full article Keith highlights behaviours that are avoidable during research sessions. I found these particularly interesting:

> 3. Go to sessions with an open mind. It’s all too easy to attend a single lab session with the intention of confirming an existing hunch or assumption.
> 9. If you have it, compare your test participant’s behaviour with data from your live or beta service.
