Since the lockdown I’ve had to be inventive in my home working setup to overcome wifi dead zones. Our garden office is one such place. We’ve got an ethernet cable installed but as we’re just out of reach of the home wifi we’ve racked up pretty big data bills on our mobile phones. Since I had Raspberry Pi 3b+ awaiting it’s next duty and a bit of spare time over the festive break, I followed this excellent tutorial to setup setup an access point. It worked a treat!
