Things to consider:

* Recruitment
 * Recruit a mix of disabilities and assistive technology
 * There will be overlap (Intersectionality) - focus on access needs and technology used
* Stimulus
 * Ensure the fidelity and execution of the testing stimulus is accessible to those who are testing it (functional HTML = assistive technologies)

Recruitment examples:

* Generative / Discovery research - broad approach for variety of disabilities, assistive technologies, behaviours.
* Iterative design - focus on matching participants and prototypes, broader inclusion of access needs across studies.
* Evaluative research - more specific to cover a a variety of disabilities and assistive technologies.

Accessibility all the way:

* Telepresence software, consent forms, surveys, PDFs should all be accessible.
* Lab / testing location and furniture accessibility.
* Be prepared and allow for more time to make any alterations of specific requests.
