Things to consider:

* Goals
  * Continuous research with fewer participants or dedicated research with more participants (_former is better_)
* Fatigue
  * Longer sessions ~90mins
  * Review the session design to avoid fatigue
* Budget
  * Potentially a harder recruit, allow for more recruitment time and incentive cost
* Location
  * Some labs may have specific accessibility software but need to be accessible
  * Paricipant’s home/workplace offer more contextual insight to other access needs
  * Location of test incurs more travel cost
  * Remote tests must use accessible software and ability to capture audio (screenreader)
