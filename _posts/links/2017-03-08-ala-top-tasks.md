### The problem

* The ease of publishing content leads to bloated website and admin systems that eventually require redesigning
* These redesigns become glossy facade fixes atop of the unchanged mess of information and content

### Introducing Top Tasks Management

Top tasks are:

* Small set of the most important tasks for your customers
* Numbering between 2-10 tasks

The objective is to get these core tasks working as well as possible otherwise, you run a high risk of losing your customer. Doing this by reducing the complexity by identifying what **really** matters to the customer.

Additionally involves deemphasising the smaller less important tasks that, over time, contribute to a much bigger drain of resource and value to the customer.

Less important tasks typically generate more content by the organisation.

### Identifying Top Tasks

#### Get the organisation involved gathering tasks

Objective - build empathy with the customer, understand how they think.

Change the mindset - what does the customer want rather than what the organisation want.

Data sources for gathering tasks:

* Organisational philosophy - strategy, vision and objectives
* Customer feedback - survey, help inquiries, support team insights
* Stakeholder insight - considerations for top tasks
* Competitor or peer websites - review similar tasks across domain
* Traditional and social media - open discussions on various channels
* Site behaviour analysis - top visited and interacted pages and assets
* Search analysis - most popular site and public search engine search terms

Two reasons why most popular pages and search keyword aren’t enough:

1. They reflect what content you have maybe not what your customers want. These pages might also be a mix of top and tiny tasks.
2. Search doesn’t give you the bigger picture. Bookmarked top tasks and well-constructed navigations mean tiny tasks are more likely to be searched for.

The gathered lists usually contain duplicates, overlapping areas, internal jargon.

#### Generate a shortlist with stakeholders

Objective - cut the list down to a maximum shortlist of 100 tasks.

Duration - 4-6 weeks to do the research and generate the shortlist.

Tips on shortlist generation:

1. **Use clear language** - avoid jargon and other technological or marketing-centric terminology.
2. **Omit specific references to products or features and avoid using group names** - use general terms that can cover all instances of product related tasks.
3. **Merge overlapping tasks** - consider combining similar tasks into a single more generic task.
4. **Avoid high-level concepts and goals** - try to maintain tasks to a similar level and differentiated from the overall customer goal. Goal = the change, Task = the thing the customer needs to do to help achieve that goal.
5. **Exclude audience and demographic** - tasks should be universal.
6. **Use nouns for tasks** - avoid using for tasks if possible, scannability is improved by omitting verbs.
7. **Avoid repetition** - aim for no more than 4 tasks that have the same first word.
8. **Keep it brief** - max of 7 words or 55 characters per task.

Subtasks should include 2-3 examples and added to parentheses e.g. _Task (subtask, subtask, subtask)_

The objective here is to involving as many teams and gain consensus from as many key stakeholders as possible. There may be a need to bend the rules to prove that one top task isn’t needed or to observe customers reactions.

#### Get customers to vote and rank

The shortlist is then sent to a representative sample of customers to complete.

They must:

1. Choose 5 tasks that matter most to them
2. Rank the chosen 5 tasks - 5 = most important, 1 = least important

The survey design is such for two reasons:

1. It forces a gut reaction - what customers do vs what they say
2. It exposes the top tasks and the tiny tasks as a hierarchy of importance

#### Order tasks by highest/lowest vote

Results of the survey will expose the top, medium, small and tiny tasks.

### Benefits

Top Tasks Management is an evidence-based collaborative approach which can be applied periodically to check customer’s top tasks.

The value is also found for the organisation in cross-team collaboration and shared understanding.
