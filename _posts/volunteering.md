# Volunteering

I got into volunteering for web conferences about a year ago. I was in-between jobs and wanted to do something constructive with my time, meet some like-minded people and learn something that might help in the second round of approaching interviews. Around that time I noticed a call for volunteers for an upcoming web conference in my Twitter feed, I was free for the dates so I put myself forward.

That event was [UX London](http://2013.uxlondon.com/), the annual three-day conference organised by Brighton based UX design consultancy [Clearleft](http://clearleft.com/).

Shortly after my inquiry, I received an email requesting the days I was available to help prior, during and after the the conference. I had time on my hands and was eager to get stuck in so I put myself forward for everything going.

## Pre-setup

UX London sees about xxxx delegates over the three days, each one needing to be registered their first day of arrival. A good proportion of the pre-conference setup was preparing the material for both sides of the registration table.

As proof of registration and general admittance to the talks and workshops, each delegates receives a lanyard. One of the first jobs was labelling, alphabetising lanyards and finally them against the register to ensure everyone has been accounted for. This includes the event’s speakers, sponsors, volunteers and the organisers themselves.

Granted it’s pretty repetitive work but gave me a good opportunity to get to know the fellow volunteers and meet the organisers. As a bonus, Clearleft kindly paid for lunch too.

## Venue Setup

Volunteers who were available for the venue setup arrived the day before the event to meet the organisers, go through the order of play, familiarise themselves with the building, unpack the conference equipment and finally sort and pack the xxxx complementary goodie bags each delegate gets on registration.

Again the repetitive nature of the task meant you could chat amongst the group and by the evening’s end you’ve made some really good fiends.

## Registration

Registration was from 9am and as a volunteer you were expected to arrive at least an hour before this time to go through the register process, help setup the front desks, sort the afternoon’s workshop materials and the obligatory round of hi5’s.

Come 9am, it was all hands on deck. The majority of the tasks in the next 2-3 hour window had been planned out but it was up to you to use your initiative; if a delegate looked lost you'd ask if you could point them in the right direction, if you saw a volunteer with a queue of delegates you'd go over and relieve them, if you had nothing to do you'd check if there was anything you could help with. General team work basically. 

Manning the front registration desk for the first time was rather daunting, the responsibility of getting the hundreds of attendees through the doors quickly, politely and without error was a bit of an unknown and I wanted to do the best I could.

The 2013 event was slightly different to previous years:

* A new venue – [Trinity Laban](http://www.trinitylaban.ac.uk/hire/our-spaces)
* Daily 50/50 split of talks and workshops
* Tickets for 1-3 days

Each of these
