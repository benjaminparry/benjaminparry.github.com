## Deconstructing project failure

* The difficult part is the **doing**
* Project kick off is already too late, seeds have already been sown for failure
* Starting is crucial
* Define the problems early

Problem: **Selling the project**

* e.g. time since re-design
* “this time it’s going to be different”
* Overselling is a risk – stakeholders expectations are high

Problem: **Estimation bias - humans are terrible at estimating the potential issues (failure)**

* resources
* design blockers

Solution: **Become product rather than project centric**

* learning cycle is too short with large/long projects
* start moving budgets into smaller changes - opex rather than capex
* shorter iterations, continuous cycles
* manage expectations more easily

---

Problem: **We estimate at the point in the project when we know the least**

* ballpark figure becomes the budget
* ballpark referred to later on

Problem: **We didn’t have the right people in the room**

* understanding organisations
* different value places into the involvement in the process
* involve the right people - the product team;  developers, designers etc
* [planning poker exercise](https://www.crisp.se/bocker-och-produkter/planning-poker){:target="_blank"} for user stories
* timing is key

Solution: **A good scoping phase**

* explain the discovery stage
* talk to customers, stakeholders
* use personas, user journey maps, user stories
* trial and error
* sell back to the organisation
* manage expectations

---

Problem: **Technology is surprisingly opinionated**

* generic technology is opinionated
* opinions are baked into technology
* this has a knock-on effect

Problem: **Selecting your technology platform too early can paint you into a corner**

* added too early from a list of requirements
* CTOs love shopping and tech
* suppliers are great at selling tech
* miss-sold tech is rampant - once invested the flaws start to show
* hard to turn back once invested

Solution: **Design from the outside in**

0. design user journeys
0. prototype
0. then approach tech

---

Problem: **Agile isn’t a cure-all**

* you have company buy-in but …
* challenging in it’s own right
* *successfully modern waterfall approach can work*
* huge commitment going full-agile
* agile is an all-in company approach
* certainty to stakeholders on delivering
* difficult for ‘command and control’ teams
* referred to as “fragile”
* agile is cross-team and consensus agreement

Solution: **Try being agile (lowercase a)**

* start with critical project
* start slow and small
* develop stakeholder understanding
* building culture
* refer to the [agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/){:target="_blank"}

---

Problem: **Scope creep**

* agile allows for scope creep
* new priorities, market change, timeline change
* bloated if not controlled

Solution: **A kick-ass product manager with real authority**

* being there 100%
* real ownership of the product and decisions
* continuous feedback to the company
* needs to be in-house
* *hard to find*
* sits between UX design, tech, business
* understands goals, budgets, user experience
* mediator between teams
* unique and valuable
* clear governance structure/program in place
* senior stakeholders own the outcomes but not the output - decides on the what not the how

---

Problem: **Organisational silos**

* improve efficiency
* breeds knowledge gaps
* design » dev handover void and process misunderstanding
* demoralising for any group within the organisation

Solution: **Product teams and cross functional pairing**

* work as product teams
* involve everyone
* user stories - a snapshot of a conversation and decision as a group
* shared understanding

> Question: **_How should cross functional pairing change over a project duration or multiple sprints?_** 
> 
> * Use your best judgement
> * It depends on the project, stage and team
> * Irrelevant if the teams are already committed to the culture

---

Problem: **A talented but inexperienced team**

* soft skills matter
* broad experience make great designers

Solution: **Get external help and perspective**

* bring in freelancers, agency, coaches
* share the risk
* bring in and work with the internal team
* mentorship
* extract the talent

---

Problem: **You select the agency on pitch**

* pitfalls when working with them
* big pitches = big promises
* underquote to please - sometimes intentional, sometimes not

Solution: **Try working with them first**

* they challenge you
* paid pitches
* solve a problem together
* bring teams together to discover relationships
* try a design sprint and integrate teams

---

## Design is a culture problem
* **change the way you do business**
* **hard for one person to change the whole culture**
* **find allies**
