Prerequisites for this guide:

* Install Plex on a Raspberry Pi
* Install OpenMediaVault on a Raspberry Pi

Iâ€™m a big fan of Plex. It subscribes to my guiding principle of owning my own content and offers a robust framework for accessing on my home network and also remotely.

I had it running on an old Mac Mini for a while but when that hardware bit the dust I was curious as to whether it could run on a Raspberry Pi. It turns out it can and does a really good job at it too.

Running Plex on a Pi has a few advantages.

* Physically smaller
* Lower power consumption
* Can be run headlessly over SSH
* Open source software FTW!
* There is a specific Linux build of Plex

More recently I have been interested in investigating a NAS and a newly bought 4GB Pi 4 offer an opportunity to leverage the beefier hardware to run both.

OpenMediaVault is an open source

Steps

* Create a user in OpenMediaVault for Plex to access your files
* Create the mount folders on the Plex Pi
* Edit the fstab to include the command for mounting the Samba directory

List mounted drives `diskutil list`
