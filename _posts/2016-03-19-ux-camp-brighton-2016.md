By **Andrea Saez** [@dreasaez](https://twitter.com/dreasaez){:target="_blank"}

### Onboarding

* Not a perfect artform
* Goal to create a successful product + engaged user
* Fails when the user didn’t understand the value of the product
* Design the behavior
* Commit early
* Figure out the blockers
* Examine the outcomes
* Slack as an example as success … *but you’re not Slack and your app does more than that*

### Give them something to focus on

* [Shopify](https://www.shopify.co.uk/){:target="_blank"} e.g. - numbered steps to engage the user
* [Prodpad](https://www.prodpad.com/){:target="_blank"} case study
  * cohort analysis (time form trial to conversion)
  * conversion times 6-10 weeks » 4-6 weeks with onboarding changes
  * drip flow emails to increase product engagement
  * start with the first 30 seconds
  * understanding the why of the tasks (user)
* 3 click rule: no more than that results in difficult to learn the IA

### Open discussion

* Anchor.fm - short audio messaging
* Users are impatient
* [Tictail](https://tictail.com/){:target="_blank"} onboarding: tasks - suggested text + t+c to move the user through the onboarding process quicker
* Adding friction: increase commitment and value by adding friction where it makes sense
* Feature bloat: [Appcues](http://www.appcues.com/){:target="_blank"} case study.
  * aggressive onboarding
  * understanding tasks
  * through this you gain a better understanding what features your users actually need
  * what problem are you trying solve?
* Help mechanisms:
  * videos
  * demos
  * text
  * lots of different solutions
  * you are not your market!
  * assume the user always knows less
  * users don’t read
* Pace of onboarding: it depends on the user e.g. service provider/consumer contexts might require slower/quicker more/less speed or friction

## <a href="#initiating-ux-through-resistance" class="heading__anchor" id="initiating-ux-through-resistance"><span class="heading__anchor__text">Initiating UX Through Resistance</span></a>

By **Gultekin Irengun** [@mgirengun](https://twitter.com/mgirengun){:target="_blank"}

### How to integrate UX into an established product?

#### Friction and blockers

* Legacy code
* CEO doesn’t know/understand UX
* Budgets
* Delays
* Methods for CEO buy-in
* UX != visual design
* Testing iterations = time
* Business time and customer barriers
* You can be the only UX team member - cross over skills

### Three opportunities and resources

* Usability tests
* Product research
* Business priorities

0. Customer snapshot: survey with Google Docs - leveraging customer service knowledge
0. Company meetings: presenting UX standpoint - achieve shared understanding across the team and company
0. Customer service: collaborative design - different customer touchpoint - *what about conflict with marketing?* less so with software design but might occur with the marketing site

* UX team is the 1st to understand the customers goals are
* Different objectives
* Feed back into the business
* Goal design - feature requests

### Legacy code

* Roadblocks to improvements
* Need of a product owner
* Utilize the scrum master and project manager
* Start a conversation with the the project owner - get them to engage with UX
* UX into scrum - UX sprint 2 weeks prior to any development
* Mock ups and mid-fidelity (axure etc) prototypes to help understand the workings
* Angular templating framework to inject new code and UX into a legacy UI

By **Natalia Rey** [@mikitcha](https://twitter.com/mikitcha){:target="_blank"}

* Use consistent patterns
* Reviewing the overall interaction design: highlights user goals - justify the changes
* Problem based on customer complaints: direct

### Users have different motives

* Motivation - Feelings
* Framing - Thinking
* Behaviour - Doing

### Questions

* Development engagement and buy-in
* Think into the situations
* *Appropriate user persona e.g. motivations etc?*  Aligned with the business and collaborative process
* *Testing the motivation?* Done during the user research stage

## <a href="#iterative-personas" class="heading__anchor" id="iterative-personas"><span class="heading__anchor__text">Iterative Personas</span></a>

By **Adrian Howard** [@adrianh](https://twitter.com/adrianh){:target="_blank"}

### How do we understand out customers?

* Twitter for cats: point of reference different for all teams - no shared understanding = a bad customer experience
* UX solution is the persona: deliverable - helps with empathy - good for generating ideas - shared understanding + happy customer

### Persona Problems

* Presented as truth: customer’s needs change over time
* Large investment of time and money and people
* Good understanding of customer base
* Out of date persona deliverable
* Products change over time and outgrow the personas

> “Personas are to Persona Descriptions as Vacations are to Souvenir Picture Albums” - Jared Spool

**The photo album is not the same as the holiday experience.**

### ~~Lean~~ Iterative Persona

0. Define: initial alignment - who are we building it for - customer touch - empathy maps Dave Gray - shared understanding
  * Apply a `“made shit up” «» “true”` scale - have conversations - surface the details - get stability - push “true” point of reference
  * Add structure - sift through the details - used with empathy maps
  * Visualizing the customer - supporting details to further the character and motives of the customer - e.g. gender - more research
0. Define rules - visualizing ongoing research - leads to product decisions and prototypes - prompts further questions
0. Realign - split and merge personas
  * Communicates risk and confidence, **not truth** - start with the simpler routes and decisions
  * Whole team commits
  * Buy-in

### Summing Up

* Early alignment
* Scale up with truth
* Add rules
* Step back

### Questions

* Hypothisis about users, customere and product features
* Go for the truth straight away

0. Analyze the user/behavior flow - better ways to view bigger sites
0. Tracking in-page elements - what visitors do on the page - carrousels
0. Goals:
  * What is a goal - e.g. signing up for a newsletter
  * Goal reports - device analysis
  * Goal values

0. Page value formula
0. Calculate leakage
  * sum *see slide*
  * prompt changes to user journey
0. Device specific issues
  * page performance
  * testing page
0. Heat mapping - user behavior and intent e.g. unclickable links = more information needed
0. Scroll mapping - where the focus is on the page
0. Compare the competition - benchmarking against other sites
0. How users arrive - e.g. social, email, direct etc
0. Prove your hypothesis - back up the ideas … or not.
0. A/B testing
0. Identify user groups - e.g. segment age groups
0. Automate some of your reports - automated email

## <a href="#organizational-culture-and-ux-design" class="heading__anchor" id="organizational-culture-and-ux-design"><span class="heading__anchor__text">Organizational Culture and UX Design</span></a>

*speaker unknown*

* Each culture is different
* Communication map

### Workshop objectives

* 4 company culture types based on **Competing Values Framework** by Cameron & Quinn
* (see slide diagram)
* xy axis =
  * **Adhocracy** - values are to create something new - shy away from processes
  * **Clan** - create a good community - all-in meeting - avoid conflict - very slow
  * **Hierarchy** - focused on processes - top down
  * **Market** - externally focused - stable - e.g. Google, need to be iterative want to be first and best - need proof to validate this

### Questions and discussion

* We change our behavior when dealing with one of the above
* Further Reading: Kim Goodwin’s presentation - competing values framework - communication techniques




## <a href="#the-project-pre-mortem" class="heading__anchor" id="the-project-pre-mortem"><span class="heading__anchor__text">The Project Pre-Mortem</span></a>

By **Tom Prior** [@tomprior](https://twitter.com/tomprior){:target="_blank"}

* Hindsight is a great things
* How to avoid making the same mistakes?
* Post-mortom - mitigate pitfalls
  * everyone benefits apart from the patient (project)
  * Inner-team conflict - uncomfotable -
  * Flushes out potential other problems (company culture)

* Pre-mortem - from Gamestorming book - Gary Klein
  * Harnesses predicted faluire - improves 30%
  * Project is already a disaster

### How it runs

* All present involved in the Project
* Include the client

0. Frame the project
0. Image complete disaster
0. Generate reasons for failure - competition to find unfound ways of failure
0. Theme and prioritise - focus on showstoppers or frequent problems - vote on themes (priority dot voting)
0. Brainstorm solutions
0. Agree actions - owner scrum master

### Recap

0. Image compelte failure
0. Generate reasons for failure
0. Themes and prioritise
0. BrainstormAgree actions

Making course corrections - use retrospectives to route check and change tack

### Benefits

* Improves the odds of success
* Encourages team work
* Starts the project with a win

### Questions & discussion

* *Client billing?* Yes. More to maintain afterward.

## <a href="#how-to-ask-better-questions-from-asking-better-questions" class="heading__anchor" id="how-to-ask-better-questions-from-asking-better-questions"><span class="heading__anchor__text">How To Ask Better Questions From Asking Better Questions</span></a>

By **Chris How** [@chrishow](https://twitter.com/chrishow){:target="_blank"}

### What makes a good question?

Better questions move things forward - Einstein quote
Questions are scary - senior

0. **Ends in a question mark**
 * who?
 * why?
 * what?
 * when?
 * how?
0. **Has a purpose**
  * what do they want to get out of the session? 
  * what’s the hypothesis?
0. **Gives insight that is actionable** - cash for answers
0. **Opens up a conversation**
  * closed questions - yes or no answers
  * clarification if fine
  * don’t constrain the answers
0. **Neutral and free of bias**
 * charged words e.g. “do you think”, “would you agree”, “tell me about about our new and exciting designs”
0. **It’s interesting**
  * it’s a tiring process
  * omit useless questions
0. **Is short**
  * avoid “and”, commas, to many words *>12 words should be trimmed* **lesses understanding of question**
0. **Can be answered**
  * “*what do* you do…” rather than “*what would* you do…”
