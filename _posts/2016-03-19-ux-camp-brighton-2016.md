# The First 30 Seconds: Let’s talk User Onboarding

Andrea @dreasaez

Not perfect artform
Successfull product + user
Didn’t understand the value of the product
Design the behaviour
Commit early
Figure out the blockers
Examine the outcomes
Slack as an example as success … but you’re not Slack and your app does more

Give them something to focus on
Shopitfy c.s. - steps
Prodpad c.s. - cohort analysis - time form trial to conversion - 6-10 weeks » 4-6 weeks with onboarding changes - drip flow emails to prod engagement - start with the first 30 seconds - understanding the why of the tasks
3 click rule - no more than that - more difficult to learn the IA

---

## Open discussion

Anchor.fm - short audio messaging
Impatient users
Tictail onboarding - tasks - suggested test + t+c -
Adding friction - increase commitment and value by adding friction
Feature bloat - appques c.s. - aggressive onboarding - understanding tasks - through this you gain a better understanding what features ur users actually need - what problem are you trying solve
Help - videos - demos - text - lots of different - you are not your market - assume the user is always stupid - users don’t read
Pace of onboarding - it depends on the user e.g. service provider/consumer

# Initiating through resistance

How to integrate UX into an established product?
Legacy code
CEO doesn’t know/understand UX
Budget
Delays
Methods for CEO buy-in
UX != visual design
Testing iterations = time
Business time and customer barriers
You can be the only UX team member - cross over skills

## Three opportunities and resources

* Usability tests
* Product research
* Business priorities

0. Customer snapshot - survey - Google docs - customer service touchpoint -
0. Company meetings - presenting UX standpoint - shared understanding
0. Customer service - collaborative design - different customer touchpoint - *what about conflict with marketing?* less so with software design but might occur with the marketing site

1st person to understand the customers goals are
Different objectives
Feed into the business
Goal design - feature requests

## Legacy code

> Marcus @ airline booking + legacy code - marcus@mdibb.com

Roadblocks to improvements
Get a product owner
Scrum master and project master
Start a conversation with the the project owner - get them to engage with UX
UX into scrum - UX sprint 2 weeks prior
Mock ups and low-fidelity (axure etc) prototypes to help understand
Angular templating framework to inject new code and UX into

---

# Questions

Axure is mid-fidelity quality, are there expectations that less will change
