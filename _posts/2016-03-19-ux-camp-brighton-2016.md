# The First 30 Seconds: Let’s talk User Onboarding

Andrea @dreasaez

Not perfect artform
Successfull product + user
Didn’t understand the value of the product
Design the behaviour
Commit early
Figure out the blockers
Examine the outcomes
Slack as an example as success … but you’re not Slack and your app does more

Give them something to focus on
Shopitfy c.s. - steps
Prodpad c.s. - cohort analysis - time form trial to conversion - 6-10 weeks » 4-6 weeks with onboarding changes - drip flow emails to prod engagement - start with the first 30 seconds - understanding the why of the tasks
3 click rule - no more than that - more difficult to learn the IA

---

## Open discussion

Anchor.fm - short audio messaging
Impatient users
Tictail onboarding - tasks - suggested test + t+c -
Adding friction - increase commitment and value by adding friction
Feature bloat - appques c.s. - aggressive onboarding - understanding tasks - through this you gain a better understanding what features ur users actually need - what problem are you trying solve
Help - videos - demos - text - lots of different - you are not your market - assume the user is always stupid - users don’t read
Pace of onboarding - it depends on the user e.g. service provider/consumer

# Initiating through resistance

How to integrate UX into an established product?
Legacy code
CEO doesn’t know/understand UX
Budget
Delays
Methods for CEO buy-in
UX != visual design
Testing iterations = time
Business time and customer barriers
You can be the only UX team member - cross over skills

## Three opportunities and resources

* Usability tests
* Product research
* Business priorities

0. Customer snapshot - survey - Google docs - customer service touchpoint -
0. Company meetings - presenting UX standpoint - shared understanding
0. Customer service - collaborative design - different customer touchpoint - *what about conflict with marketing?* less so with software design but might occur with the marketing site

1st person to understand the customers goals are
Different objectives
Feed into the business
Goal design - feature requests

## Legacy code

> Marcus @ airline booking + legacy code - marcus@mdibb.com

Roadblocks to improvements
Get a product owner
Scrum master and project master
Start a conversation with the the project owner - get them to engage with UX
UX into scrum - UX sprint 2 weeks prior
Mock ups and low-fidelity (axure etc) prototypes to help understand
Angular templating framework to inject new code and UX into

---

# Questions

Axure is mid-fidelity quality, are there expectations that less will change

</div>

<div id="">

# Title - Name

@user


* [missing]
* Consistent Pattens
* Reviewing the overall interaction design - highlights user goals - justify the changes
* Problem based on customer complaints - direct

Case study - persona

* Users have different motives

* Motivation - Feelings
* Framing - Thinking
* Behaviour - Doing

---

# Questions

* Development engagement and buy-in
* Think into the situations
* *Appropriate user persona - motivations etc?*  Aligned with the business and collaborative process
* *Testing the motivation?* - User research stage

</div>

# Iterative Personas -

@adrianh

---

## How do we understand out customers?

Twitter for cats - teams buidlding different things - no shared understanding = bas customer experience
UX solution is the persona - deliverable - helps with empathy - good for generating ideas - shared understanding + happy customer

## Persona Problems

Presented as truth - customer’s needs change over time
Large investiment of time and money and people
Good understanding of customer base
Out of date persona deliverable
Products change over time

Personas are to Persona Descriptions as Vacations are to Souvenir Picture Albums - Jared Spool » The photo album is not the same as the experience.

## ~~Lean~~ Iterative Persona

0. Define - initial alignemt - who are we building it for - customer touch - empathy maps Dave Gray - shared understanding
  * Apply a `made shit up «--------------» true` - conversations - surface the details - get stability - move true point of reference
  * Add structure - sift throught the details - used with empathy maps
  * Visualising the customer - supporting details to further the character and motives of the customer - e.g. gender - more research
0. Define rules - visualising ongoing research - leads to product decisions and prototypes - propmts further questions
0. Realign - split and merge personas
  * Comunicates risk and confidence, **not truth** - start with the simpler routes and decisions
  * Whole team commits
  * Buy-in

## Summing Up

* Early alsignent
* Scale up with truth
* Add rules
* Step back

---

# Questions

* Hypothisis about users, customere and product features
* Go for the truth straight away

# Analytics

@lukehay

---

0. Use google Analytics - easy to setup - documented - free
gachecker.com - checks whole website for tracking -
Filter out spam/bots traffic - google doing well to filter this out - filter out unwanted spam - link to follow
Find out about your users - international visits - demographics (newish) - from adwork data - interesting when combined with other data e.g. gender split of visitors - analyze cahnges
Most visited pages - quality vs quantity
Bounce vs Exits - see diagram - don]t confuse the touchpoint
Analyze the user/behaviour flow - better ways to view bigger sites
Tracking in-page elements - what visitors do on the page - carrousels
Goals -
* What is a goal - e.g. signing up for a newsletter
* Goal reports - device analysis
* Goal values -
Page value - (see slide) calcualte the value of each page
Page value formular
Calcualte leakage - (sum - see slide) - prompt changes to user journey
Device specific issues - page performance - testing page
Heatmapping - user behaviour and intent e.g. unclickable links = more infomation needed
Scrollmapping - where the focus is on the page
Compare the competition - benchmarking against other sites
How users arrive - e.g. social, email, direct etc
Prove your Hypothisis
