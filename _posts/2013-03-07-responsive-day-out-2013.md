After Wednesday night’s toweringly inspirational talks at [Altitude](http://altitude.io/) and a short but sweet Shopify meetup on Thursday night, I was hungry the meat potatoes and pint o’Guinness portion of last week’s web conference schedule.

Other than regularly attending meetups and the occasional BarCamp, this was my first time at a full-day conference and my expectations couldn’t have been set higher after the aforementioned events.

I’ve read Ethan’s book and loosely followed the current unfoldings of the responsive image proposals, I haven’t actually put much into practice and was ready to get my brains learned out.

*And Boy, did I get the learning of my life!?!*

## Sarah Parmenter

I heard Sarah speak two days earlier at Altitude, the overall format there was informal banter so this was a great opportunity to hear her give a more structured presentation.

### Notes:

**Intro**

+ “Breakpoints, where the design breaks” (great explanation)
+ We need to start sharing all parts of the process, even the shitty ones, especially in RWD

**Tools**

+ InDesign solution for RWD mock-up designs
+ Photoshop is considered a taboo but has it’s place

**Workflow and Process**

1. Content structure
2. UX wireframes
3. Design elements/atmosphere
4. Optomisation
5. HTML/CSS/JS

**Static visuals**

+ “The code is the deliverable, the PSDs are not.” [@Mike_FTW](https://twitter.com/brad_frost/status/225674332230283265)

**Getting sign-off**

+ Get content first
+ Omit unnecessary content
+ Crazy egg tool (??? – in my notes, no idea what it refers to)
+ Get sign-off on content hierarchy
+ Sign-off on partial/fragmented designs, not as a whole

**Pattern library**

+ Different to style guides
+ Pattern libraries give context
+ Style guides are pure visual/decorative
+ Get sign-off first

**Asset management**

+ [Slicey.app](http://macrabbit.com/slicy/)

**Closing thought**

+ “We’re still adapting to the RWD process, it’s a continuously evolving discipline”
