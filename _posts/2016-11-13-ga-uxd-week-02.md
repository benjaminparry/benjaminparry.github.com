## Session 03 - User Research

### Objectives

1. Introduce the skills needed for effective interviewing
2. Explain the benefits of contextual enquiry
3. Cover techniques for ensuring unbiased interview questions
4. Draft an interview discussion guide

### Class Slides

#### Introducing User Research

* Social media has bred a culture of complaing making it easier for customers to openly converse with companies with their problems
* Users are experts in their problems but not experts in the solutions
* It’s important to keep a record of quotes both good and bad
* Unlike quantitate research that explains the *what*, user interviews offers the qualitative research that explains the *why*

#### Research Types

* **Generative:** utilised when a working with a new solution
* **Evaluative:** utilised when a solution already exists

#### Why Do The Research?

* High-risk to the business by not doing so
* Gives an objective view on the solution
* “You are not the user”
* Builds empathy with your potential or current users

##### Discover Habits

* Ask why, preferably 5 times
* Don’t assume you know why
* Ask questions
* People make up things when they can’t remember, find truths to acknowledge responses

##### Discover Workarounds

* How are they currently fixing their problem?
* What are they using?
* Why are they using this particular workaround? What works, what doesn’t?

##### Contextual Inquiry

* Introduces the context to the task
* Unpacks all the other conditions that effect the process of completing a task
* Spread the sample research

#### User Interviews

* Define goals of the research
* Understand business goals
   * Their (stakeholders) needs
   * Their assumptions
* Use a discussion guide
  * Helps to keep the conversation flow going after a tangental discussion
  * Enables a structured interview and gain the insights you are searching for

#### Interview Preperation

* Record the interview if possible
  * Enables playback for more focused note-taking
  * Note-taking during the interview can be distracting and limits your concentration on the flow of the conversation
* If offering payment/reward for the interview, present before the interview commences
  * This avoids giving the impression the participant needs to say the right things and impress
* Make them feel comfortable
* Interview with the users who will actually be using the product, not those who are at management or higher level
* Identify other stakeholders and collaborative services e.g.
  * Government
  * Council
  * Charity

#### Body Language

* Your body language will contribute to the sucess of the interview
* your participants will reflect your body language, try to remain relaxed and open 

#### Moderating

* Don’t control the conversation
* Ask open ended questions
* Take note of personal stories
* Improvise when discussions take an interesting path (up to 50 max)

#### Discussion Guide

* Total of around 10-12 questions
* Make note of services and products used - competitors
* Listen to but put aside and don’t dwell on offered solutions
* Focus on:
  * Observations
  * Quotes
  * Inferences
* Evaluate what people like about a product/service - ask them to guide you through the experience

### Class Exercise

To introduce this process practically, the class was given a theme of financial budgeting and contactless payments to research. We split into pairs to:

1. Define our research goals
2. Find out what we need to understand and empathise with our users
3. Outline 5 questions to ask so we can fully understand the problem

With these written we rotated amongst the group to conduct user interviews.

### Homework

* Write an interview discussion guide
* Complete 4 user interviews
* Submit discussion guide and written interview notes

## Session 04 - Competitive Research

### Objectives

1. Compare products in the same industry
2. Understand direct and indirect competition
3. Group exercise to relate to final project

### Class Slides

#### Business Needs

* Balanced with the needs of the user
* What are the business goals?
* Stakeholder management

#### Acheiving Balance

* Tech - Risk
* Business - Cost
* User - Experience

#### Never A Black Canvas

* Internal politics
* Resources
* Tech contraints
* Product managers

#### Assumptions

* Ask why
* Dig deeper
* Repeat back to validate your understanding
* Would would success for the business look like?
* OKRs, KPIs come later, strive for a statement of change in future state
* Find out what the business is trying to achieve and why is it doing it
* Understanding is the goal

#### Stakeholder Research

* Test with a competitors site if you have nothing built
* Test how it works not how it looks
* Conduct usability testing

#### Task Analysis

* Test competitor sites with your users
* You are not testing the critical user journey
* Have lots of tasks tested by your users

#### Case Study - Uber

* **Uber** serves…
  * People
  * Packages
  * Food
* JTBD - what is the job?
* The competition might not always be obvious

#### Parity Is Not A Strategy

* Feature competition is a waste of time unless validated
* Not knowing why a competitors product is designed the way it is and replicating regardless is a high-risk manoeuvre
* Our goals at this stage is to understand why, not simply pick a solution that seems to fit

#### Approaches

* Feature inventory
  * Identify gaps and opportunities, talk to users and validate
  * Can be presented as subjective data
  * Comparison matrix
* Pluses and deltas
  * Strengths and weaknesses
  * Good and bad points
  * Can be subjective

#### Analysis

* Important to communicate between teams
* Feature creep is not an option
* Is there an unmet need?
* Having no competition might be a problem
* Same feature set but a better experience - validate this by user research
* Scaling a product e.g. iPhone » iPad
* Validate any assumptions
* Let the interviews unpack the opportunities

#### Opportunities

* Having a niche is important
* Ask what job the user is hiring the product for, how can you do the same job?
* Think about the value chain of the business
* Be broad to find out how jobs are being done

#### Goal

* Where are the gaps? How can they be filled?
* How can the experience be improved?
* Look for the unmet needs

### Class Exercise

In pairs the class applied competitor research to web-based event ticket services [Twickets](https://www.twickets.co.uk){:target="_blank"} and [Viagogo](http://www.viagogo.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}.

### Homework
