## Session 03 - User Research

### Objective

1. Introduce the skills needed for effective interviewing
2. Explain the benefits of contextural enquiry
3. Cover techniques for ensuring unbiased interview questions
4. Draft an interview discussion guide

### Class slides

#### Introducing user research

* Social media has bred a culture of complaing making it easier for customers to openly converse with companies with their problems
* Users are experts in their problems but not experts in the solutions
* It’s important to keep a record of quotes both good and bad
* Unlike quantative research that explains the *what*, user interviews offers the qualatative research that explains the *why*

#### Research types

* **Generative:** utilised when a working with a new solution
* **Evaluative:** ulatised when a solution already exists

#### Why do the research?

* High-risk to the business by not doing so
* Gives an objective view on the solution
* “You are not the user”
* Builds empathy with your potential or current users

##### Discover Habits

* Ask why, prefereably 5 times
* Don’t assume you know why
* Ask questions
* People make up things when they can’t remember, find truths to acknowledge responses

##### Discover Workarounds

* How are they currently fixing their problem?
* What are they using?
* Why are they using this particular workaround? What works, what doesn’t?

##### Contexual Inquiry

* Introduces the context to the task
* Unpacks all the other conditions that effect the process of completing a task
* Spread the sample research

#### User Interviews

* Define goals of the research
* Understand business goals
   * Their (stakeholders) needs
   * Their assuptions
* Use a discussion guide
  * Helps to keep the conversation flow going after a tangental discussion
  * Enables a structured interview and gain the insights you are searching for

#### Interview Prep

* Record the interview if possible
  * Enables playback for more focused notetaking
  * Notetaking during the interview can be distracting and limits your concentration on the flow of the conversation
* If offering payment/reward for the interview, present before the interview comences
  * This avoids giving the impression the participant needs to say the right things and impress
* Make them feel comfortable
* Interview with the users who will actually be using the product, not those who are at management or higher level
* Indentify other stakeholders and collaborative services e.g.
  * Government
  * Council
  * Charity

#### Body Language

* Your body language will contribute to the sucess of the interview - 

### Class Exercise

To introduce this process practically, the class was given a theme of financial budgeting and contactless payments to research. We split into pairs to:

1. Define our research goals
2. Find out what we need to understand and empathise with our users
3. Outline 5 questions to ask so we can fully understand the problem

With these written we rotated amongst the group to conduct user interviews.
