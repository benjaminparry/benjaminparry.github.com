## Monday

I arrived in Brighton town at least an hour early to grab a 2nd breakfast and walk off the nerves I had lingering before joining the team at 11am. I wanted to quickly get into a headspace that I could carry though my 3-month experience at Clearleft.

James Box had invited me into the office the previous Wednesday for a catchup to discuss my experience at GA, what I wanted to get out of the 3-months and . It also gave me an opportunity to be introduced to those Clearleft team members I hadn’t yet met.

With the coffee machine primed and at it’s optimum tempreture, the Clearleft coffee drinkers started rolling in like they occupied some sort of sixth sense for caffine.
