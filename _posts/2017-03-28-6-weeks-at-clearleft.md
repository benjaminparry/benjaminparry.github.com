## Setting the bar

A few weeks before arriving at Clearleft I set myself a challenge of documenting and publishing my experience on a daily basis. I was inspired by [John Ellison’s 90 Days](https://90days.john-ellison.com/){:target=“blank”} who did exactly this. It provided a valuable insight into what to expect as someone about to embark on an internship. But it quickly became apparent that I wasn’t going to match John’s output and that a weekly blog post was probably more likely. Weekly blog post milestones soon turned to fortnightly, fortnightly to monthly until I succumbed to the realisation that I would eventually get time to write something. It took 6 weeks.

Kudos to John for finding the time and energy to maintain the writing challenge.

## 42 Days Earlier

Rewind to start day; Monday morning, walking to 68 Middle Street, nerves suddenly kicking in. My coping mechanism was to imagine I was walking into week 2, with all of week 1’s intros and settling in out of the way, ready to get to work. After all, that’s the exact reason I’m here.

I was quickly snapped up by Steph and Hannah and used as a guinea pig to run through a usability testing script they were using for the rest of the week. Shortly after that I was whisked into a UX London meeting with Kate and Nicky.

By the early afternoon I’d been given my welcome pack, set up with the usual digital communication necessities and treated to a welcome lunch at the local Thai restaurant.

### Stationary stationery

In the afternoon Ben Sauer invited me to join him on a conference call for a potential client in Chicago. Ben had been personally requested by the client as a good fit for the project and there were talks of a possible short engagement that would take the form of a design sprint.

The conversation ebbed and flowed through various aspects of the product; prototype feedback, vision and roadmap, ethics, outcomes vs outputs, expectations and assumptions, and finally how Clearleft – Ben – might fit into the puzzle.

After the call Ben and I discussed our observations and concerns and the merits of a strategic vs tactical angle for the design sprint. He also reframed the roles the founder, himself, and the development team through [Simon Wardley’s *Pioneers, Settlers and Town Planners*](http://blog.gardeviance.org/2012/06/pioneers-settlers-and-town-planners.html){:target=“_blank”}.

* **Pioneer** - Someone with a new view of the world - The founder
* **Settler** - Someone who helps turn that new view into a thing - Ben
* **Town Planner** - Someone who oversees the process - The development team

We both agreed that we didn’t fully understand certain minutiae that was core to understanding the service as a whole. Further research was required.

It was abundantly clear that the values and ethics of a project are core deciding factors for taking on a project, both at an individual and organisation level. Ben was also stressed the importance of feeling confident that he, and by extension Clearleft, could legitimately deliver value.

There were questions of whether technology would be effective for this particular product/service and concerns of neglecting other touch points along the journey.

All this gave me food for thought for the bus journey home.

## Back for seconds
