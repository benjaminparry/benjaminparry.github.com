## Setting the bar

A few weeks before arriving at Clearleft I set myself a challenge of documenting and publishing my experience on a daily basis. I was inspired by [John Ellison’s 90 Days](https://90days.john-ellison.com/){:target=“blank”} who did exactly this. It provided a valuable insight into what to expect as someone about to embark on an internship. But it quickly became apparent that I wasn’t going to match John’s output and that a weekly blog post was probably more likely. Weekly blog post milestones soon turned to fortnightly, fortnightly to monthly until I succumbed to the realisation that I would eventually get time to write something. It took 6 weeks.

Kudos to John for finding the time and energy to maintain the writing challenge.

## 42 Days Earlier - Day 1

Rewind to start day; Monday morning, walking to 68 Middle Street, nerves suddenly kicking in. My coping mechanism was to imagine I was walking into week 2, with all of week 1’s intros and settling in out of the way, ready to get to work. After all, that’s the exact reason I’m here.

I was quickly snapped up by Steph and Hana and used as a guinea pig to run through a usability testing script they were using for the rest of the week. Shortly after that I was whisked into a UX London meeting with Kate and Nicky.

By the early afternoon I’d been given my welcome pack, set up with the usual digital communication necessities and treated to a welcome lunch at the local Thai restaurant.

### Stationary stationery

In the afternoon Ben S invited me to join him on a conference call for a potential client in Chicago. Ben had been personally requested by the client as a good fit for the project and there were talks of a possible short engagement that would take the form of a design sprint.

The conversation ebbed and flowed through various aspects of the product; prototype feedback, vision and roadmap, ethics, outcomes vs outputs, expectations and assumptions, and finally how Clearleft – Ben – might fit into the puzzle.

After the call Ben and I discussed our observations and concerns and the merits of a strategic vs tactical angle for the design sprint. He also reframed the roles the founder, himself, and the development team through [Simon Wardley’s *Pioneers, Settlers and Town Planners*](http://blog.gardeviance.org/2012/06/pioneers-settlers-and-town-planners.html){:target=“_blank”}.

* **Pioneer** - Someone with a new view of the world - The founder
* **Settler** - Someone who helps turn that new view into a thing - Ben
* **Town Planner** - Someone who oversees the process - The development team

We both agreed that we didn’t fully understand certain minutiae that was core to understanding the service as a whole. Further research was required.

It was abundantly clear that the values and ethics of a project are core deciding factors for taking on a project, both at an individual and organisation level. Ben was also stressed the importance of feeling confident that he, and by extension Clearleft, could legitimately deliver value.

There were questions of whether technology would be effective for this particular product/service and concerns of neglecting other touch points along the journey.

All this gave me food for thought for the bus journey home.

## Back for seconds - Day 2

Day 2 started bright and early with a guided tour of the coffee machine via Ben White’s beautifully designed coffee making instructions pinned on the wall. Clearleft don’t mess around when it comes to coffee, or anything food and drink related for that matter.

Rich then mentions that he and Jon have some competitor analysis to pour over and I would be most welcome to join them later on in the day.

Once caffeinated I’m asked by Ellen if I’m available to help out on the Clearleft website…

… and this is the point when I learn that the 3 months at Clearleft will have me pulled by various people onto various projects at any moment. I’m not suggesting by any means that this is this a bad thing, only something to be aware of and that the accountability for managing your own time is yours the moment you walk through the door.

### Get up, stand up

Once accepting Ellen’s offer I’m onboard the all-hands-on-deck train the new website over the line. The first port of call is the daily standup let by Matt, who’s been brought in for the last few weeks of the project to “herd the cats”.

The previous day’s objectives were replayed and progress was reported back in a round robin fashion.

#### “Who’s responsible…”

What I’m immediately struck by is how quickly people take ownership of issues and mutually agree on be the best person to delegate to. _These cats are collectively herding themselves!_

Until now I’ve had a rather love/hate relationship with the daily standup; love because of the potential to establish a shared understanding between a team/organisation and the efficiency of flushing blockers out into the open to get squashed, hate when they are unled and without purpose and met with a collective slump and sigh. This though was a breath of fresh air.

With the day’s objectives set, the team split and work commenced. For the rest of the day Ellen walked me through what was needed to assist in the mass migration of content from Clearleft v4 to v5.

## Purpose - Day 3

I walked into the office on Wednesday with purpose. It felt great to be adding value to a project that needed extra resource at such an early stage.

Digging deeper into Clearleft’s methods, services and case studies was an interesting lens to reflect on what I wanted to gain during the 3 months here. What skill sets have I brought with me? Where do I want to upskill? Where would I fit into an organisation like Clearleft?

One thing I was sure about. It would be all too easy to stay in my safe zone and focus development on my current interaction design skills. What I want is to be exposed to the two areas of UX I’m most interested in; research and strategy.

With a pleasant one-to-one seaside walk with James the day way rounded off nicely.

##  Onboarding - Day 4

Shortly after the daily clearleft.com standup Andy T walked Ben S and I through a long-running project that was poised to re-configure into three different streams.

The Clearleft team had embedded themselves onsite and worked within the team to see them through the changes they needed to make to get them to this position.

The change was to enable three different objectives;

1. Further embed a Lean/Build, Measure, Learn process that supports the freedom to ship small, fast and often
2. A longterm strategic vision team
3. And an exploratory team that sits in the middle of both of these teams

This middle Explore team would be responsible for what comes next. Alleviating the more ambitious, technical and time expensive changes not feasible from the BML team, while focused on the longterm vision.

This would take the form of a few extended design sprints, further developing the internal design advocation while driving product innovation.

The prospect of working on this project was incredibly exciting and seemed the perfect opportunity to be exposed to new methods of working while continuing to add value to the team by employing a required skill set. Ace!

### Playbacks

Ben then took the opportunity to playback Monday’s call to Andy and discuss some ways to approach the design sprint if he were to take it on.

We returned to many of the themes we had touched upon directly after Monday’s call; domain knowledge, software fit, tactical vs strategic approach, scope, purpose.

Andy and Ben then discussed how to frame the approach. Andy suggested using the top layer of the [Project Canvas](https://cleverdigit.com/2015/09/07/canvassing-a-project/){:target=“blank”} only, something he had been playing with of late. Armed with Post-it notes and Sharpies they then fleshed out the genesis of a plan for the design sprint with some of the deliverables.

*Taken from scribbled notes…*

1. Head in the game
* orientation
* project canvas top layer
* define the problem; you, users, how?
* [GV Sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint/){:target=“blank”} activities
* presentation
2. Customers
* empathy map
* new/old method deep dive
* competition and market definition
* activities from [Value Proposition Design](https://strategyzer.com/books/value-proposition-design){:target=“blank”}
* recap; gaps, users, teachers
3. Scenarios and Empathy

### “Is _this_ the laundromat?”

A few room changes later, packed like sardines in a tin, the UX team got cosy for a rebooted UX Laundromat.

The Laundromat is an hour squirrelled away for the UX team to get together each week to… well, that was the theme for this week’s assembly. _Well meta!_

Out of the discussion the #thelaundrybasket was formed, a Slack channel could use as a running commentary of what we were working on.

### Work hard, play hard 

After shutting up shop, the whole Clearleft gang reconvened at the local pub to kickstart Charlotte’s leaving party. Craft beers flowing and records and pizzas spinning till the late, late evening.

## Friday - Day 5

The week ended with a fairly sore head. With the daily standup complete it was all hands on deck to chip through the remaining Clearleft.com tasks.

### Pow wow!

After a company lunch at the local pub – there’s a pattern forming here I think… – Kate, Alis, Nicky and I meet for a UX London pow wow to discuss ways we can improve the conference experience for delegates, crew (volunteers), and Clearleft as a whole.

Both Nicky and I had volunteered for Clearleft’s conferences before so we both had suggestions to contribute. I turns out Kate had been sharing my blogpost [Why I Volunteer and Why You Should Too](http://benjamin.parry.is/writing/2016/09/why-i-volunteer-and-why-you-should-too/) to prospective volunteers.
