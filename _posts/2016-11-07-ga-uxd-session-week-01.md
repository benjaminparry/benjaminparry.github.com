## Course introduction

### Course approach and technique

* Lean UX methodology
* Using Google Venture’s Design Sprint
* Applying design thinking to the process
* The final project deliverable will be native app focused

### Course structure

* Each session will cover a new topic and clearly outline the objectives
* Each week will consist of pre-work, session work and homework
* Pre-work is a primer for the topics covered in the next session e.g. an article or video (1hr)
* Session work is hands on working in rotation with fellow students in a workshop style practice (2x 2hr in-class sessions)
* Homework is dedicated to the course final/main project (3-4hrs)
* Once a final project topic has been chosen it will be the focus for each week of the class

### Course tools

* Prototyping tools - Sketch and Marvel or Invision
* All homework will be set and submitted through Basecamp
* Class communication is via a Slack channel 

### Advice for getting the most out of the Course

* Get the homework in on time
* Push through the emotional cycle of change
* Download a copy of session presentations for reference
* Concentrate on homework over pre-work
* Make your final project your passion

## Session 01 keynote

### Objective

* Define the elements of UX
* Explore the techniques of problem solving, innovation, user centered design and design thinking
* Sketch out potential design solutions to real world problems

### What is user experience?

* UX is ubiquitous
* We have both physical and digital experiences
* It occurs while we, as users, try to achieve our goals

### Case studies

* Starbucks - order on the go
* Uber - competitor landscape (direct and indirect)
* Instagram - consistent design (happy path, decision points)

### User experience definitions

> Experience design is the design of anything independent of medium, or across media, with human experience as an explicit outcome and human engagement as an explicit goal.
>
> Jesse James Garret

> User experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the company, its services, and its products.
>
> Donald Norman

### Examples of good and bad user experience

* Underground signage in Japan clearly visible and native language nonspecific - good
* Underground signage in London hidden and confusing - bad
* City Mapper enabling non-native speaking users to navigate cities - good
* Doors with handles both sides but only swing one way - bad
* Google Photos lowering user effort, automating gallery creation and making it easier to share photos - good
* Google Photos showing anniversary photos that evoke sad memories - bad

### Good UX case study

#### John Lewis

* Caters for all the experience touch points 
  * physical shop
  * website
  * purchase
  * delivery
  * installation
  * after care
  
#### Amazon

* Amazon Prime targets particular user base/audience
* Website isn’t overly designed
* Has accumulated a lot investment from users

### What makes for a bad UX

* Poorly designed products
* Poor wayfinding
* Social media plays a big part of customer experience and reflects to the brand

### Design thinking

* Start with empathy
* Understand our users needs, motivators and behaviors enables us, as designers, to make more informed decisions

#### Interviewing techniques and advice

* **Don’t** ask users what they want - users know their problems not the solutions to them
* **Do** ask about the best time, the worst time, the most recent time
* Practice active listening
  * ask why
  * the best interviews are free-flowing conversations that ebb and flow through the topic of your research
  * silence = thinking - don’t interrupt it
* Ask about a typical day
* Be aware that moods fluctuate during the day
* Discussion guide - https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/discussion-guides.html
* Notetaking is a good idea, additionally the audio can be recorded for convenient playback
* Quotes are good - affinity mapping
* outline key takeaways
  
## Session 01 workshop

### Redesigning the laundry

To introduce the class to design thinking, the rest of the session was dedicated to researching our experiences with clothes washing/laundry. The class split into pairs and spending roughly 10 mins interviewed each other to extrapolate potential problems to try and solve.
