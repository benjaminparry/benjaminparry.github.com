### Virgin Holidays

* ‘margin gains’ - 1% improvement of all things rewards a greater yeild, albiet not noticible straight away
  * “It's so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making better decisions on a daily basis. Almost every habit that you have—good or bad—is the result of many small decisions over time. And yet, how easily we forget this when we want to make a change.”

## Wednesday

### Chat with Richard - Trusted Review

* Faceted search
  * How it benefits the [n] different customers and their existing behaviour and motivations
* Advertising
  * Viewability - https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/infographics/5-factors-of-viewability.html
* Advertising targets - e.g Ford advertising to tech-savy camera enthusiasts. Ford have limited growth with existing customers so targeting potential customers within a tech-savy arena is an opportunity for growth.
* Challenges
  * Filling advertisement inventory
  * Responsive - existing m-dot equivelant and desktop experience
  * 
* Three types of visitors
  * News readers - coming to the site to read ~3,000 word in-depth articles to brain-up on the details for social gains. Not in the mind to buy
  * Customers:
    * Need to buy - item is broken need to make a purchase, might need further advice/guidance - hot lead
    * Want to buy - aspires to buy a product, needs extra information - warm lead
