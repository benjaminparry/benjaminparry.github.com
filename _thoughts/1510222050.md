After some self-reflection this week, I’ve tried to come up with *my own* answer to the question “What is User Experience?”

> UX refers to the emotional response a user has while using a product, whether they intentional or otherwise.
>
> A designer who is sympathetic to UX, will curate journeys that are simple, pleasant and reliable.

This will most probably evolve over time but I wanted a record of it somewhere. This seemed like a good place.
