	<h2>Process</h2>
	<p><strong>Problems:</strong></p>

	<img src="/im/case-study/vidivici/full/vidivici-navigation-old--main.png">
	<ul>
		<li>User feedback and research highlighted problems with the main navigation. By default it wad hidden and shown on logo hover. The majority of users found it unintuitive.</li>
	</ul>
	<img src="/im/case-study/vidivici/full/vidivici-navigation-old--improvements.png">
	<ul>
		<li>Portfolio improvement notifications sere separated from the main navigation and also displayed on hover. This again caused confusion for the user.</li>
	</ul>
	<img src="/im/case-study/vidivici/full/vidivici-navigation-old--search.png">
	<ul>
		<li>Research showed some users weren&rsquo;t familiar with auto-complete searches and were looking for an indication of searching and either a button to click or pressing enter to confirm, neither of which were present.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
	
	<img src="/im/case-study/vidivici/full/vidivici-navigation-new--main.png">
	<ul>
		<li>After reviewing the categorization analysis it was much clearer how the top-level task based navigation should be constructed: home, research, portfolios, user profile, settings, help.</li>
		<li>Secondary task based navigation was applied based on card sorting activities.</li>
	</ul>

	<img src="/im/case-study/vidivici/full/vidivici-navigation-new--search.png">
	<ul>
		<li>The research section was designed to show search results with optional related searches, progress indication was also added.</li>
		<li>Classic inbox-style notifications were added to the relevant portfolio, these were also included in the portfolio page search widget.</li>
		<li>User avatar&rsquo;s were also designed into the navigation</li>
	</ul>
