> # View widget concept

> **Task:**

> * Refine the visual concept of a user&rsquo;s view within the site feed
> * Develop an icon set to communicate current view and changes since last time expressed (to be used in other components)
> * Improve interaction to promote more frequent view entry

> *Design mock-ups, scheduled for development mid 2013*

	<h2>Process</h2>
	<p><strong>Problems:</strong></p>

	<img src="/im/case-study/vidivici/full/vidivici-view-widget-concept--previous.png">
	<ul>
		<li>Repetitive information</li>
		<li>Impersonal and lack of user individuality</li>
		<li>Verbose/confusing language</li>
		<li>Disjointed placement of current icon set</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
	<img src="/im/case-study/vidivici/full/vidivici-view-widget-concept--without-price-target.png">
	<ul>
		<li>Setting new views and updating existing ones had to include a price target whereas comments were optional. To stimulate more conversation in the site, one direction was to reverse the current model so that comments are compulsory.</li>
		<li>Additional conversational support for user mentions and replies was also designed.</li>
		<li>Similar to user mentions, company mentions e.g. LSE:VOD for Vodafone, were also designed to hook into various feeds across the site. Both user and company mentions linked to the relevant pages on the site and are added via the comment input field.</li>
		<li>View owner and timestamp are clearly separated and linked accordingly.</li>
	</ul>
	<img src="/im/case-study/vidivici/full/vidivici-view-widget-concept--with-price-target.png">
	<ul>
		<li>Adding the optional price target is a simple extension of the base view model: an short-form price target and a set of three icons, both linked accordingly.</li>
		<li>The short-form price target was designed to be used both as a readable non-graphical summary and a short-cut entry method that bypasses the views chart, and a way to add price targets via third party connected services like Twitter.</li>
		<li>An example: <strong>LSE:LLOY +24% ~66.18p 2/4mths</strong> translates to <em>&ldquo;I think that Lloyds Banking Group PLCâ€™s stock price will increase by 24% to roughly 66.18p per share in the next 2-4 months&rdquo;</em></li>
		<li>As a starting point, the view dot icon was designed to match the scale of the dots on the views chart, from that scale the other icons were designed to communicate the sentiment of the view, either positive (up) negative (down) or no-change(equals), and the credibility star rating of the view. This icon set was also used elsewhere in other modules.</li>
	</ul>
