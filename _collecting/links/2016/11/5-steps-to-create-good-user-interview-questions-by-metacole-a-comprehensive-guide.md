* User interviews enable you to:
  * speak directly to your users
  * have specific questions answered
  * uncover previously unknown details and directions
* Badly scripted questions can:
  * result in biased questions and therefore biased answers
  * lead to a flawed foundation to product and business decisions
  
### 1. Start with a problem statement

* What are the questions you want answered?
* Create a list of all the questions you need answered to gain better understanding

### 2. Reframe the problem statements

* Rephrase the questions from different perspectives:
  * logical/rationale-driven
  * emotion/desire-driven
  * product/consumer-focused
* Benefits:
  * uncovers additional opportunities to learn about your users, specifically those you hadn’t previously considered
  * creates the foundation of your interview questions

### 3. Develop your questions

* Avoid leading questions
  * Leading questions will influence the answers you receive from you interviewees
  * They infer that something is true where it might not be
* Avoid speculative questions
  * if asking about the past, be as specific as possible
  * speculative questions invite interviewees to fill in the gaps or completely invent a scenario
  * aim for genuine and insightful data
* Ask open-ended questions
  * open-ended questions invite interviewees to add details around the central theme
  * answers to open-ended questions unpack invaluable information that would otherwise be undiscovered by a more specific question
* Ask multiple questions to inquire about one thing
  * offers an opportunity to verify that you’ve understood the interviewee and check for contradictions
  * avoid asking these questions concurrently, instead pick a the next natural moment in the flow of conversation
  * [data triangulation](http://www.write.com/writing-guides/research-writing/research-process/data-triangulation-how-the-triangulation-of-data-strengthens-your-research/){:target="_blank"} can also help
  * Avoid asking if an interviewee would purchase or use the product
    * this is an uncomfortable position for your interviewee to be put in and they will probably say “yes” even if they don’t mean it
    * instead, ask about their [intent to purchase](http://boxesandarrows.com/intent-to-solve/){:target="_blank"}

### 4. Be prepared to paraphrase your questions

* it’s possible an interviewee won’t understand your question
* being prepared to rephrase a question will keep the interview flowing

### 5. Add structure to your question list

1. Introduction
  * put the interviewee at ease by explaining the purpose of the interview and where the data is going
  * avoid explainig too much to maintain natural responses to questions
  * Thank the interview for attending and introduce yourself
  * keep the introduction brief
  * ask permission: audio and video recording, photos etc
2. Warm up
  * ask 3-5 generic questions
    * occupation/what’s an average day like?
    * hobbies
    * internet usage
3. Main
  * ask as much as possible
  * start with specific past events then speculative questions
  * ask questions that suit the conversation, introduce the theme then dig deeper
4. Wrap up
  * make it clear that the interview is over
  * ask if they have any questions
  * thank then for their time and contribution
