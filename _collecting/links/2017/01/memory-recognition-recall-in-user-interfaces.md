>> Search suggestions are a major advance in search usability because they partly transform the query generation task from one of recall to one of recognition.

>> Other tools that let users save information in an app or on a website (favorites, wish lists, shopping lists, etc.) all help with making content easily accessible via recognition.

>> Many mobile apps start with tutorials that explain to users how they are supposed to use the apps. People are supposed to memorize that information and remember it when they need it.

>> The app also heavily relies on gestures; the gestures are taught during an initial tutorial, but the user needs to recall them later on. A tip that evokes the gesture in context would also go a long way to making the app more usable. (Yes, the app allows users to practice these gestures during the tutorial, but most people need more than one repetition to learn.)
