posse: 🤔 Is going “full dumbphone” really necessary? Here’s my thoughts on dumbing down the smartphone

Ben W recently wrote a post about the [relaunched Nokia 3310](https://clearleft.com/posts/433){:target="_blank"}. He’s not alone in the Clearleft HQ to approve of the reboot and there’s a general consensus this is the start of the “backlash” against device addiction.

Kicking about in the bottom of our household’s tech graveyard – we all have one right? – is a Nokia 3100 and I’ve been tempted on a few occasions to fire it up for a dummy run. But as much as I’d love to permanently ditch the smartphone there’s a few things that would make the daily grind a little rougher without one.

1. **Maps** - The freedom that a GPS signal and reliably mapped cities and towns offer is liberating, to say the least.
2. **Monzo** - Monzo, the ‘bank as smart as your phone’, has turned out to be an incredibly joyous experience for the few months I’ve been using it. However, much like Instagram used to be, there is not currently a web account interface so all admin is via your smartphone. Dumbphone = Dumbbank.
3. **Digital Bus Tickets** - The thought of having to use a top up card, corner shop weekly ticket or paying on the bus feels like too much of a step backwards to me.

But what about that “backlash”? Do we need to take such drastic measures as ditching all the smartness? Where’s the middle ground?

A few people have mentioned [Glued app](http://www.glued.to/){:target="_blank"} but I can’t help but feel cynical about installing an app that tells me when enough is enough. I’m after fewer distractions, not more.

Around the summer of 2016 I read Jake Knapp’s article [The distraction-free iPhone (or ‘Why I’m happier since I disabled Safari’)](https://medium.com/time-dorks/the-distraction-free-iphone-or-why-im-happier-since-i-disabled-safari-80f8d525b0d8#.lz8vhofip){:target="_blank"} and tried out his suggestions.

His article explains the week long experiment of removing/disabling the following apps from his phone.

* Social media
* Email
* Web browser (via Restrictions on an iPhone)
* Anything installed to whittle away time

I also moved all home entertainment apps like Netflix and iPlayer to the family iPad, having this separate device for play lessens the temptation to pick up your phone.

After a week or so of fighting the muscle memory of turning my phone on for no apparent reason, I began to pay it less attention. It no longer had to be within an arm’s length at all times, the battery lasted longer, I started looking up more, I started reading books on public transport, and most importantly I had no reason to take it into the loo anymore!

I also devised a method of managing apps that remained on the phone. I created three folders in the iPhone home screen dock; Frequent, Occasional and Seldom. If I used an app every day it went into Frequent, infrequently used apps went into Occasional, everything else went into Seldom and probable contenders for being removed completely.

Since starting at Clearleft I’ve installed Slack so I can drop a message to the team if I’m running late. But with any app with a feed or content that can be affixed with reactions, the hook model soon kicks in and becomes addictive.

_… hang on a sec, that gives me an idea for a kaizen!_
