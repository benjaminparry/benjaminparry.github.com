Ben W recently wrote a post about the [relaunched Nokia 3310](https://clearleft.com/posts/433){:target="_blank"}. He‚Äôs not alone in the Clearleft HQ that fully approve of the reboot and agree that this is the start of the ‚Äúbacklash‚Äù against device addiction.

Kicking about in the bottom of my random tech drawer ‚Äì we all have one right? ‚Äì is a [phone type] and I‚Äôve been temped on a few occations to fire it up for a trial dumbphone run. But as much as I‚Äôd love to permenantly ditch the smart phone there‚Äôs a few things that would make the daily grind a little more rough without one.

1. **Maps** - The freedom that a GPS signal and reliably mapped cities and towns offers is liberating to say the least.
2. **Monzo** - Monzo, the ‚Äòbank as smart as your phone‚Äô, has turned out to be an increadibly joyous experience for the few months I‚Äôve been using it. Howerver, much like Instagram used to be, there is no web account interface at present so all admin is via your smartphone. Carrying a smartphone is core it it‚Äôs value.
3. **Digital Bus Tickets** - The thought of having to use a topup card, cornershop wwekly ticket or paying on the bus feels like too much of a step backward to me.

But what about that ‚Äúbacklash‚Äù? Do we need to take such drastic measures such as diching all the smartness? Is there a compromise?

A few people have mentioned [Glued app](http://www.glued.to/){:target="_blank"} but I can‚Äôt help but feel cynical about installing an app that tells me when enough is enough. Less is more.

Around the summer of 2016 I read Jake Knapp‚Äôs [The distraction-free iPhone (or ‚ÄòWhy I‚Äôm happier since I disabled Safari‚Äô)](https://medium.com/time-dorks/the-distraction-free-iphone-or-why-im-happier-since-i-disabled-safari-80f8d525b0d8#.lz8vhofip){:target="_blank"} article and tried out his suggestions.

His article explains the week long experiment of removing/disabling the following apps from his phone;

* Social media
* Email
* Web browser (via Restrictions on an iPhone)
* Anything installed to whittle away time

I also moved all home related media apps like Netflix and iPlayer to the family iPad. This further removes the tempation to leave one of these entertainment apps on your phone and clearly defines one device for entertainment. 

After a week or so of fighting the muscle memory of turning my phone on for no apparent reason, I began to pay it less attention. It no longer had to be within an arms length at all times, the battery lasted longer, I started reading books on public transport, and most importantly I had no reason to take it into the loo anymore!

I also devised a method of managing apps that were on the phone. I created three folders in the iPhone homescreen dock named Frequent, Occasional and Seldom. If I used an app everyday it went into Frequent, infrequently used apps went into Occasional, everything else went into Seldom and are probably contenders for being removed completely.

Since starting at Clearleft I‚Äôve installed Slack to drop a message to the team if I‚Äôm running late. But with any app with a feed or messages that can be affixed with reations, it soons becomes an addiction.

Hang on a sec, that gives me an idea for a kaizen!
