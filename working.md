# What I'm working on

I’ve been working for financial webapp startup company Vidivici since January 2011.

In that time we’ve built embeddable components for 2 large online brokerage websites and developed our own fully-fledged web service capable of full portfolio synchronization at [vidivici.com](http://vidivici.com).

Technologies we’ve embraced:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* SVG and Canvas
* Knockout.js
* Sass and Compass

I’m currently responsible for UX/UI design and frontend build of the webapp. We work in an Agile development environment, something that I was unaware of at first but have learned to embrace the frantic pace of change and find a design system that fits to the workflow.

To put this in context, before this I was working at a slow digital agency in London where I had little to nothing to do and “try to look busy” was often instruction given by my project manager, so things couldn’t be more different.
