# Case Study

## UX/UI designer at Vidivici

***

> [Vidivici](http://vidivici.com) is like TripAdvisor for investment. It’s a views sharing platform that can help you manage your money.

***

### Preface:

I joined Vidivici just after they received funding from online brokerage [SharePrice.co.uk](http://www.shareprice.co.uk) to provide an embeddable view sharing service on their website.

This first stage of the service was to include components that capture user’s forward looking views on the market and a secondary notification component that provides tailored improvements to their user’s portfolios that the user could either accept of discard.

The second stage was a complete standalone website of our own, with full broker integration and two-way synchronisation of user’s portfolio and transactions.

### Process:

1. **Establishing product goals and dependencies**
	+ Initial research into product flow
	+ Establish task priorities and dependencies
	+ Produce flow diagrams
2. **User research**
	+ Establishing the target user requirements
	+ Breakdown of tasks based on time/frequency
3. **User flows**
	+ Analysis of user expectations
4. **Wireframing**
	+ Initial paper sketches
	+ Creation of rough pattern library and product tone
5. **Rapid prototyping**
	+ Basic prototyping based on tasks
6. **Agile development and re-design iteration**
	+ Expansions and redesign iterations of above
7. **User testing and feedback**
	+ Staged user testing at point 2, 3, 4, 6


### Main challenges and solutions:

The main challenge throughout the process was condensing a relatively complicated concept into a weightless task. The target users were ones with little or no experience in finance so the product would have to approach the core tasks from a different perspective.

**Problem:** Traditional finance charting and jargon are overly cryptic and confusing.

**Solution:** Use new language and UI concepts for traditional actions like Buy or Sell.

Traditional portfolio visitations and tasks like *Buy* or *Sell* are character-centric, i.e. the UI is based on decimal places and form based. This gives a macro view of the current state of your portfolio as a whole.

With Vidivici, the approach was to drop one-sided tasks like Buy or Sell and refer to the task as a whole, *Edit* or *Change*. A complete re-think of the portfolio visualisation was required to complement this new language, and augmentation of different states depending on which states were active.

User testing indicated that these concept motivated the user to play and experiment with their portfolio, which was one of the major requirements of the UX design.
