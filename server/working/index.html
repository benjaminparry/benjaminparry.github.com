      <h1>What I'm working on</h1>

<p>I’ve been working for the financial webapp startup company Vidivici since January 2011.</p>

<p>In that time we’ve built embeddable components for 2 large online brokerage websites and also our own fully-fledged web service capable of full portfolio synchronization at vidivici.com.</p>

<p>Current technologies used:</p>

<ul>
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>CSS3</li>
<li>SVG and Canvas</li>
<li>Knockout.js</li>
<li>Sass and Compass</li>
</ul>


<p>I’m currently responsible for UX/UI design and frontend build of the webapp. We work in an Agile development environment, something that I was unaware of at first but have learned to embrace the frantic pace of change and find a design system that fits to the workflow.</p>

<p>To put this in context, before this I was working at a slow digital agency in London where I had little to nothing to do and “try to look busy” was often instruction given by my project manager, so things couldn’t be more different.</p>
