> # Asset allocation concept

> **Task:**

> * Develop an intuitive interface for users to constrain their portfolio
> * Supply a method for searching for and creating new constraint
> * Include validation where current allocations fall outside of constraints
> * Display graphically both the current and target allocations

> *Design mock-ups, scheduled for development mid-late 2013*
