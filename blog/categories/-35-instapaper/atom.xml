    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>This is part of a talk I will be giving at <a href="http://2012.barcampbrighton.org/" title="BarCampBrighton 7 homepage">BarCampBrighton 7</a> <strong>My attempt at the perfect read-later workflow</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>For a while I've been obsessed with nailing a perfect read-later workflow for online publishing. I use Instapaper a lot and do most of my reading, distraction-free, on my 3rd gen. Kindle. I joined <a href="ifttt.com/" title="If This Then That">IFTTT</a> while in Beta and been using it as the missing link in this workflow. Lastly, my social media of choice is Twitter…<em>for now anyway</em>.</p>

<p>The aim of this workflow is to automate the read-later process as much as possible and document relevant posts for future reference.</p>

<p>Like most services now, Instapaper has a "Like" feature. If I read something that strikes a chord in me, I "Like" it. This is great from an archivist perspective but what else can I do with it? I don't always have time to compose a Tweet to the author, to be honest I'd rather just open the next article. Besides, the reason I use a Kindle is because I don't want to be distracted.</p>

<h2><a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/58465" title="Like article in Instapaper, post a custom Tweet">☆ Instapaper ☆ > Twitter</a></h2>

<p>So I created this IFTTT recipe to post a Tweet once an Instapaper is "Liked". I won't go into how and why I chose to setup the recipe the way I did, I'll leave that for another blog post <em>coming soon</em>. All I wanted to do is make sure I did something with that data, for me and the author.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure Instapaper has a Tweet facility baked-in but I prefer to use IFTTT recipes to get a little more customization into that 140-character limit.</p>

<p>My ideal automated Tweet would have:</p>

<ol>
<li>Custom text</li>
<li>Article title</li>
<li>Article link</li>
<li>Author name</li>
<li>Twitter @ handle</li>
<li>Content related hashtags per post</li>
</ol>


<p>Using the Instapaper baked-in facility lets you do 2 and 3 easily enough, next up would be visiting the blog url and using a Tweet button and customizing the text, or you could just open up your nearest device and create exactly want you want.</p>

<p>I thought I might be able to at least get the author name from the Instapaper "Liked" RSS feed but apparently not, quite an odd omission for an online/offline read-later service. I had a crack at the Instapaper <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/publishers" title="Instapaper page for controling text parsing for your site with HTML">text parsing</a>, but I must admit <a href="http://gim.ie/FqsD" title="Dog flying a helicopter">I had no idea what I was doing</a>, please <a href="http://twitter.com/benjaminparry" title="Benjamin Parry on Twitter">Tweet me</a> if you can help me out at all.</p>

<p>So IFTTT can handle 1, 2 and 3 but it seems 4, 5 and 6 have to be hacked together somehow.</p>

<h2>A blogging framework for hackers.</h2>

<p>Enter <a href="http://octopress.org/" title="Octopress blogging platform homepage">Octopress</a>. It's been a perfect excuse to get started with Github and chance for me to explore the author's place in this workflow.</p>

<p>Seeing as the Instapaper RSS feed only includes title, link, pubDate and description I decided to include the majority of the Tweet details above in the title of each post. Here's how I did that.</p>

<h3>Add author name and Twitter @ handle</h3>

<p>I tried a few different combinations of this before adding a site author in _config.yml</p>

<p><code>
author: Benjamin Parry @benjaminparry
</code></p>

<h3>Add content related hashtags per post</h3>

<p>I was already using categories so I now precede each entry with an escaped &#35; - <em>GOTCHA ~ this generates without spaces so looks slightly odd in the published url and title and auto generated Tweeted (although still works as separate hashtags and saves a few precious characters in the latter, so actually a bonus!)</em></p>

<p><code>
categories:
- &amp;amp;#35;Octopress
- &amp;amp;#35;Instapaper
- &amp;amp;#35;Twitter
</code></p>

<h3>Put it all together in the page title</h3>

<p><code>
&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#37; if page.title &amp;#37;&amp;#125;&amp;#123;&amp;#123; page.title &amp;#125;&amp;#125; by &amp;#123;&amp;#37; endif &amp;#37;&amp;#125;&amp;#123;&amp;#123; site.author &amp;#125;&amp;#125; &amp;#123;&amp;#123; page.categories &amp;#125;&amp;#125;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
</code></p>

<h3>What it looks like in a Tweet</h3>

<p><em>not tweeted yet</em></p>

<h2>Happy, Not Happy</h2>

<p>The moment I finally got this together and tested I got the email from IFTTT informing of the closure of some of the Twitter related recipe services. Luckily this recipe is safe as posting content <strong>to</strong> Twitter is allowed but posting <strong>Twitter's</strong> content to another service is not. A lucky escape, for now, although it does break some of my custom workflow that I will need to re-think.</p>
