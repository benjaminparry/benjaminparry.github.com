<h2 id="defining-the-problem">Defining The Problem</h2>

<p>The second sprint of Pagebuilder largely centred around integrating the UI into the Design area of Create and extending the array of assets of content types available to a user. The large proportion of the work was front-end focused, where my part was mainly consulting and leading problem-solving with the front-end team.</p>

<p>A few months later, we returned to the Pagebuilder Roadmap to pick up traction on scaling the product. Part of the initial customer research I’d done was to look at previously published customer sites to identify their needs from a layout viewpoint. We had implemented a fairly simplistic but manageable fractional grid layout; wholes, halves, thirds, and quarters.</p>

<p>The research also identified unequal width layouts e.g. one-third by two-thirds. Since the launch, we’d had ever increasing amounts of requests for this exact functionality or something similar. I conducted a series of customer telephone interviews about creating pages and it became apparent that this was a worthy improvement to investigate.</p>

<p>Other requests included; hero content, edge-to-edge content, and constrained content which I decided to discover as part of this investigation.</p>

<p class="challange">On the surface, adding a combination of grid sizes seemed simple, <strong>but nothing is ever simple.</strong></p>

<h2 id="">Shared Understanding</h2>

<p>There were a lot of solution assumptions being tossed around regarding this and similar improvements to Pagebuilder. It was clear that managing expectations were crucial to the success of this project and getting everyone centred on solving the same problem was the key.</p>

<h3 id="">Design Team Sketching Exercises</h3>

<p>A few weeks before I’d scheduled a weekly sketching session with the design team. This was mostly to promote sketching as a tool for divergent thinking but also to encourage talking about design choices and upskill in a design critique.</p>

<p>Using this sketching to kickstart the discovery, my goal was to use divergent thinking to discover different layouts our customers want or might want in the future. These outputs would also be used to test future solutions.</p>

<h3 id="">Cross-team Sketching Session</h3>

<p>I then ran a participatory design session with designers, developers, and stakeholders to achieve a few goals.</p>

<ol class="list list--standard">
  <li>Define the output</li>
  <li>Identify what we know about our users regarding unequal widths in particular</li>
  <li>Identify potential risks</li>
  <li>Sketch the different page layouts a user might want to achieve</li>
  <li>Sketch the CMS UI to facilitate such layouts</li>
  <li>Present their designs</li>
  <li>Dot vote on the designs they thought were worthy of exploring</li>
  <li>Define the outcome</li>
</ol>

<p>As we were pretty sure that we were going to implement unequal widths at some point the output was already defined. However, for this particular team session, I left the outcome until the very end for a reason, more on that in a bit.</p>

<p>With dot voting completed, I then asked the group to define the purpose or outcome of the changes we wanted to make, “nice websites” was the consensus. I then asked the group if there were any other changes we could make that would make a higher impact to the outcome of “nice websites”.</p>

<h3 id="">Digging Further Into The Problem</h3>

<p>After reviewing what we had sketched I invited the group back along with two members of the CS team to ensure all aspects of the team were represented.</p>

<p>The goal of this session was to:</p>

<ol class="list list--standard">
  <li>Playback the previous session for the new CS team members to bring them up to speed</li>
  <li>Facilitate a discussion about the merits and demerits of both design solutions</li>
  <li>Agree what we were going to test to validate our assumptions</li>
</ol>

<p>Two of the main concerns from the previous session were centred around the location of the unequal width settings; scalability and usability concerns of a small navigation bar, versus discoverability of a side panel.</p>

<p>During the discussion, we highlighted shared concerns for both designs and highlighted further preparatory work that we needed to do before we could start building upon the feature.</p>

<div class="conclusion">
  
  <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
  
  <p class="challange">Discussing what appeared to be a simple addition to a set of already established settings actually raised more questions than it answered.</p>
  
  <p>The process of discussion and participatory design enabled us to dig deeper into the problem and unpack the other implication of change that was at play.</p>
  
  <p>Identifying our assumptions and the risks early on meant we could strategically address those to improve learning and make the right choices for our users and product.</p>
