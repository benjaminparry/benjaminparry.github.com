<h2 id="defining-the-problem">Defining The Problem</h2>

<p>After the release of Create’s first generation responsive templates, the next challenge was to facilitate users with a responsive content and page building solution.</p>

<p class="challange">The integrated WYSIWYG editor does not, and has never, facilitated a layout option. How can we help our users create consistent and responsive page layouts?</p>

<p>Up until this point content layout was achieved via an integrated WYSIWYG editor, in this case, TinyMCE. Similar to the preceding fixed-width templates, TinyMCE used HTML tables for layout. The resulting HTML output was inconsistent from page to page and completely unworkable from a front-end responsive reflow viewpoint.</p>

<p>Initially, there were a lot of questions.</p>

<ul class="list list--standard">
  <li>What kind of pages are users already building?</li>
  <li>What are the pain points using the WYSIWYG editor currently?</li>
  <li>Do users think in terms of page types? e.g. homepage, contact page, about page</li>
  <li>Do users add content first or during the build progress?</li>
  <li>Is it important to see the design when building the content?</li>
  <li>What were our user’s expectations of building a responsive page?</li>
  <li>Do users want control over responsive layout?</li>
  <li>What do we do with the last 14 years worth of fixed-width pages?</li>
  <li>Would migrating pages be possible?</li>
</ul>

<div class="learning">
  <div class="learning__content">
    <strong>Learning: Build product pillars from user research insight</strong>
    <p>Once an understanding of your user behavior and pain points has been made, a clear foundation of what outcomes are needed becomes clearer. These acts as your guiding design principals.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="owning-the-baggage">Owning The Baggage</h3>

<p><strong>The project came with baggage:</strong> a fairly feature-rich POC that had been delivered by the development team prior to my starting. With it, a key assumption about the primary interaction design i.e. drag and drop.</p>

<p>Although most of the POC baggage was easily set aside by managing expectations of the team; accepting this as <em>a</em> design but maybe not <em>the</em> design, listening to the learnings from building the POC. However, the drag and drop requirement remained.</p>

<p>Part of the driving force for this requirement was customer requests and comparisons to competitor solutions. Competitor analysis confirmed drag and drop to be on trend, <em>but would it be right for our customers?</em></p>

<div class="learning">
  <div class="learning__content">
    <strong>Learning: Test the highest risk assumption first</strong>
    <p>A small amount of research and/or paper prototype would help to validate whether a drag and drop interaction would best suit our customers would have been more valuable at this stage of the project.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>Discovery</h2>

<h3 id="pave-the-cowpaths">Pave The Cowpaths</h3>

<p>Begining the discovery stage, I turned to the ‘<a href="https://www.create.net/examples.phtml" target="_blank">success stories</a>’ of the Create marketing website. These sites had been chosen partly for their visual quality so seemed ideal candidates for a layout and content teardown.</p>

<p>The exersize identified layout and content type patterns that informed decisions of what would be most useful for our customers.</p>

<h4>Content and Layout Patterns</h4>

<p>There were further relationships between these content types and further complexity but this was enough to validate a few of the assumptions we’d made.</p>

<ul class="list list--standard">
  <li>Image</li>
  <li>Text</li>
  <li>Heading</li>
  <li>Link</li>
  <li>Embeddable media</li>
  <li>Layout roughly arranged in multiple percentages; wholes, halves, quarters, and thirds</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="shared-understanding-through-taxonomy">Shared Understanding Through Taxonomy, IA, and Sketching</h3>

<p>Whilst Aidan explored the drag and drop feasibility, project manager Ian and I workshopped the shortlist of researched content.</p>

<p>Over the course of a few sessions, we determined the taxonomy, information architecture, a range of initial visual sketches of an interface, and a consideration for the front-end markup.</p>

<div class="learning">
  <div class="learning__content">
    <strong>Learning: Establish a common language early for better stakeholder buy-in and cross-team discussions</strong>
    <p>We immediately noticed the benefits of a robust taxonomy after our first presentation to stakeholders and beta users. Where existing projects and features have differing terms used between departments and users, Pagebuilder has a single and consistently reference terminology. <em>However, more impact could have been achieved by including cross-departmental teams across the entire project.</em></p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 id="">Maturing Concepts</h2>

<h3 id="">Mapping Purpose</h3>

<p>With pen and paper, and using existing patterns from the Create system, I began mapping the key concepts of the UI.</p>

<ul class="list list--standard">
  <li><strong>Raw material for the output</strong> - content type gallery</li>
  <li><strong>Output progress</strong> - a preview stage</li>
  <li><strong>Contextual settings</strong> - shared and unique option controls</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="">A Minimal Testable Product</h3>

<p>Aidan and I then worked closely to develop a more rounded POC, focusing on the core functionality of the UI to complete the user tasks.</p>

<ul class="list list--standard">
  <li>Adding a content block</li>
  <li>Deleting a content block</li>
  <li>Deleting a container and it’s contents</li>
</ul>

<p>Initial sketches outlining the basic behavior of the interface acted as guides for Aidan’s <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/DaXuT/1/" target="_blank">functional drag and drop POC</a>. Meanwhile, I worked on an <a href="/working/create-ecommerce-cms/pagebuilder/interaction-design-prototype/" target="_blank">interaction design prototype</a>.</p>

<div class="learning">
  <div class="learning__content">
    <strong>Learning: Diverge and test.</strong>
    <p>As the momentum gathered on the merging POCs, it became clear we were leaning toward this one idea being the one solution. Taking a more divergent approach to idea generation from the outset would have helped to avoid such high stakes against a single idea.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>A final round of wireframe iteration and user flows were presented to stakeholders, addressing their previous feedback. The green light was given and we began workign on an development environment version of Pagebuilder.</p>

<h2 id="">Build Stage</h2>

<h3 id="front-end-values">Front-end Values</h3>

<p>Before any front-end code was committed, we thought it was important to champion the front-end and design values we’d set during the responsive templates project.</p>

<ul class="list list--standard">
  <li>Mobile first</li>
  <li>Percentages, not pixels</li>
  <li>Progressive enhancement, not graceful degradation</li>
  <li>Make it accessible</li>
  <li>It’s a CMS, it won’t be perfect</li>
</ul>

<p>We extended these values and declared some unique to Pagebuilder.</p>

<ul class="list list--standard">
  <li>Content focus, not design focus</li>
  <li>Make it granular but not repetitive</li>
  <li>Don’t undo the user’s hard work</li>
  <li>Facilitate consistency and best practices without taking away choice</li>
</ul>

<div class="learning">
  <div class="learning__content">
    <strong>Learning: Build your product values from your customer research, <em>not</em> your assumptions.</strong>
    <p>One of the most challenging aspects of the project was to ensure users were building a consistent layout. We ended up making assumptions that we thought were in the user’s best interests. Our values applied to the user’s output—their website—but maybe not to their experience.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="">Final Sprint</h3>

<p>Other than the complexity of implementing drag and drop, the build stage was fairly straightforward. The previous work on the IA, taxonomy and various POCs meant of a lot of those naming decisions were already made. Also, knowing that I was also going to be doing the all of the front-end (HTML and CSS) from the outset of the project meant that I had a responsibility to think about those decisions in parallel to the UX design.</p>

<p>Once a few front-end patterns and interactions were in the front-end pattern library, and templates had been abstracted, it became a very rapid process. Worked continued until all ten of the content types had been added and the first iteration of full functionality was in place.</p>

<div class="learning">
  <div class="learning__content">
    <strong>Learning: A minimal testable product is <em>not</em> the first version.</strong>
    <p>In retrospect, there were too many assumptions at this stage of development. There was an obvious testing stage missed directly after the first content type was added. Research showed us pages almost always included either text or image. Testing a drag and drop POC with an image and text content type would have validated our riskiest assumption, tested our user’s mental model, and flagged core functionality usability issues at an earlier stage.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>A very brief internal usability testing session was run which highlighted a few minor issues that were quickly iterated on. Further testing was vetoed to the private and public beta stages.</p>

<h2 id="release">Release</h2>

<p>The private and public beta went very well, with a large proportion of the user base applying during both stages. In general, Pagebuilder was received and adopted very well and has become the default page type for all users.</p>

<div class="conclusion">
  
  <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
  
  <p class="challange">Designing for a CMS output is literally <strong>designing for the unknown</strong>. What one user finds useful, another won’t. It’s a bit like designing 10,000 edgecases. Add the complexity of responsive design into the mix and it’s on another level altogether.</p>
  
  <p>Pagebuilder was an example of those design challenges. It offered up huge learning opportunities which has influenced how we have improved the product.</p>
  
  <p>Part of it’s success was the team of allies I had the pleasure of working with Aidan’s constant questioning and promotion of accessibility best practices, Ian’s structured project management, enthusiasm for discovery.</p>
