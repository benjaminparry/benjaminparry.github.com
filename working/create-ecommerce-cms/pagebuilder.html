<h2 id="defining-the-problem">Defining The Problem</h2>

<p>After the release of Create’s first generation responsive templates, the next challange was to bring the user’s content up to similar standards.</p>

<p>Up until this point content layout was achieved via an integrated WYSIWYG editor, in this case TinyMCE. Similar to the preceding fixed-width templates, TinyMCE used HTML tables for layout. The resulting HTML output was inconsitent from page to page and completely unworkable from a front-end responsive reflow viewpoint.</p>

<h2 id="owning-the-baggage">Owning The Baggage</h2>

<p><strong>The project came with baggage:</strong> a fairly feature-rich POC that had been delivered by the development team prior to my starting. With it, a key assumption about the primary interaction design i.e. drag and drop.</p>

<p>Althought most of the POC baggage was easily set aside by managing expectations of the team; accepting this as <em>a</em> design but maybe not <em>the</em> design, listening to the learnings from building the POC. However, the drag and drop requirement reamined.</p>

<p>Part of the driving force for this requirement was customer requests and comparisons to competitor solutions. Competitor analysis confirmed drag and drop to be on trend, <em>but would it be right for our customers?</em></p>

<div class="learning">
  <div class="learning__content">
    <strong>Learning: Test the highest risk assumption first</strong>
    <p>A small amount of research and/or paper prototype would help to validate whether a drag and drop interaction would best suit our customers would have been more valuble at this stage of the project.</p>

<p>Begining the research stage, I turned to a number of customer sites to investigate what kind of page layouts they were publishing. From these sites I identified patterns of content type and layout that informed decisions of what content to start building first.</p>
